**What is a Notary Public?**  
A notary public is a public officer appointed and commissioned by the Governor whose function is to administer oaths; to take acknowledgments of deeds and other instruments; to attest to or certify photocopies of certain documents; and to perform other duties specified by law.

**Qualifications and Requirements for Appointment**

You may only be commissioned in your legal name (or a nickname of your legal name). Example: John Quinton Public could be commissioned in the names:  

> John Quinton Public  
> John Q. Public  
> J. Quinton Public  
> J. Q. Public  
> Johnny Public

You must sign notarial certificates in your commissioned name, and your notary seal must bear that name. No variation from the commissioned name is permitted.

- You must be at least 18 years of age.
- You must be a legal resident of Florida. There is no certain length of time required to establish residency. However, if the Governor's Office requires proof of residency, the following methods, along with the applicant's intent to reside in Florida, would be acceptable: a Florida driver's license; a Florida vehicle registration document; a voter's registration card; or a recorded Declaration of Domicile.
- If not a U.S. citizen, you must submit a recorded Declaration of Domicile. This affidavit is available at your county clerk's office.
- If ever convicted of a felony charge, you must have your civil rights restored.

If ever convicted of a felony or if ever charged with a felony and adjudication was withheld on the charge or the sentence was suspended, you must submit several documents:

(1) a written statement regarding the nature and circumstances of the charges;

(2) a copy of the Judgment and Sentencing Order, or a comparable court document; and,

(3) if convicted, a copy of the Certificate of Restoration of Civil Rights (or pardon). The name of this document may vary depending on the state where the conviction occurred.

This information is required for all felony convictions whether the charges were brought by the State of Florida, another state, or the United States. If adjudication was withheld and civil rights were not forfeited, the written statement and court documents are sufficient.

To obtain information about the restoration of civil rights, you may contact:

> Office of Executive Clemency  
> 2601 Blair Stone Road  
> Building C, Room 229  
> Tallahassee, FL 32399-2450  
> (850) 488-2952 [](http://voice.google.com/calls?a=nc,%2B18504882952 "Call +1 850-488-2952 via Google Voice") 

**_Note:_** _Submission of all the required information does not guarantee appointment. Decisions are made on an individual basis._

- You must take the constitutional oath of office.
- You must swear or affirm that you have read the notary laws and will obey them.
- You must complete a three hour notary education course if you are a first time applicant. §668.50(b), Fla. Stat.

**Appointment and Commission**

- Notaries are public officers appointed and commissioned by the Governor. You are not licensed, you are appointed. An appointment is a privilege, not a right.  
    
- The term of office is four years. _Example:_ A commission which began on July 1, 1996 (12:01 a.m.) will end on June 30, 2000 (12:00 p.m.).  
    
- If your lawful name changes, you must request an amended commission by submitting the appropriate application form, a rider to the notary bond, and a fee of $25. You should contact your bonding company for assistance. Once you make application for a change of name, you may continue notarizing in your former name until receipt of your amended commission and seal. You will be given a new commission number, but you will retain the same expiration date.  
    
- If you lose your commission certificate, you may request a duplicate from the Department of State, Notary Commissions and Certifications section, or from your bonding agency.

### **Application Process**

- Since July 1, 1996, applications have been submitted by bonding agencies both in paper format and in an electronic format approved by the Department of State.  
    
- The application form is prescribed by the Department of State and consists of 3 parts:

> (1) _Personal information:_ name, social security number, date of birth, sex, race, residence address, place of employment, business address, home phone, business phone, Florida driver's license number or other state issued identification, information about any previous notary commission, residency status, citizenship status, criminal record, and information about any professional licenses.
> 
> (2) _Oath of office:_ The applicant must sign the following oath. The signature is the notary's legal signature on file.

|   |
|---|
|_State of Florida __________ County_<br><br>_I do solemnly (swear) (affirm) that I will support, protect and defend the Constitution and Government of the United States and of the State of Florida; that I am duly qualified to hold office under the Constitution of the State of Florida; that I have read Chapter 117, Florida Statutes, and any amendments thereto, and know the duties, responsibilities, limitations, and powers of a notary public, and that I will honestly, diligently, and faithfully discharge the duties of Notary Public, State of Florida, on which I am now about the enter (, so help me God)._<br><br>_Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have read the foregoing application and oath and that the facts stated in it are true._<br><br>_I accept the office of Notary Public, State of Florida._|

>   
> (3) _Affidavit of Character:_ A person who is unrelated to the applicant and who has known the applicant for at least one year must give a sworn statement that the applicant is of good character.
> 
> **_Note:_** _The application form no longer requires notarization._

- The total state fees are $39.  
    $25 application fee  
    $10 commission fee  
    $ 4 education surcharge

Veterans who served during a wartime period defined in law and who have a disability rating of 50% or more are exempt from the $10 commission fee. A veteran who qualifies should request the reduction in writing and provide proof of exemption. See section 117.01(2), Florida Statutes, (effective 1/1/97).

- Once the appointment is made, the commission certificate is usually mailed back to the bonding agency, who forwards it to the notary with the notary seal.

[**Back to top**](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/chapters/office.asp#top)

### **Renewal**

- The process to renew your notary commission is exactly the same as the application process to obtain your first appointment. The application form is the same and all the required information must be submitted. See sections 117.01(2) and (6), Florida Statutes.
- The State does not notify you prior to the expiration of your notary commission. However, you will probably receive notification from your bonding agency and a number of other companies seeking your business.
- Submit your application for renewal about two months in advance of your expiration date, or earlier if your application will require special review by the Governor's Office. That should be ample time for processing to ensure that there is no break in service.
- Continue using your current notary seal through the end of your current commission. If you are reappointed, you must not use your new notary seal until the first day of your new commission. Destroy your old seal to prevent its misuse.

### **Change of Address**

- You must submit any change in writing to the Notary Commissions and Certifications section.  
    
- You are required to keep your home and business addresses and telephone numbers updated.  
    
- If you move out of state and change your legal residence, you must resign your notary commission.  
    
- To change your address, you may photocopy and use the form on page 71 of the Governor's Reference Manual for Notaries.

### **Resignation**

- When resigning your commission, you must submit a resignation in writing to the Governor's Office, return your notary commission certificate (the original, not a copy), and destroy or return your notary seal.

### **Jurisdiction**

- You may only perform your official duties within the geographical boundaries of Florida.  
    
- Notaries are appointed with statewide jurisdiction; that is, you may perform your official duties anywhere within the state. You are not confined to the county in which you reside. You should always indicate in the notarial certificate the location of the notarization, usually designated by State of Florida, County of _____.  
    
- Notaries from other states have no authority to notarize while in the State of Florida.  
    
- If you are performing your duties on an airplane or a ship, check with the pilot or the ship's captain to make sure that you are within the state boundaries.

### **Surety Bond**

- Prior to appointment, applicants must obtain a surety bond in the amount of $7,500 and maintain that bond throughout the term of appointment.
- The bond does not protect the notary. The bond is designed to protect the public against any act of misconduct or negligence in the performance of your official duties as a notary public. It does not protect you. In fact, when a notary bond is paid to some individual who was harmed as a result of an improper notarization, the bonding company will usually demand repayment from the notary.
- For your protection, you may want to carry errors and omissions insurance. Contact your bonding company for information.

[**Back to top**](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/chapters/office.asp#top)

### **Notary Seal**

- The official notary seal is the rubber stamp type seal with four elements:  
    ­- the words, "Notary Public-State of Florida"  
    ­- the notary's exact commissioned name  
    ­- the notary's commission number  
    ­- the notary's commission expiration date  
    
- The name of the notary's bonding company may be included on the seal but is not required.  
    
- The state does not furnish notary seals. You may purchase a seal from your bonding company or from a company that makes rubber stamps.  
    
- Some companies that produce notary seals include a symbol or emblem on the stamp, such as the Capitol dome, a flag, an eagle, etc., but this is optional. No emblem or symbol is required. Additionally, you may NOT use the Great Seal of the State of Florida on your notary seal.  
    
- You may sign notarial certificates with any color ink, but the notary seal must be affixed with **_black_** ink only.  
    
- You may use an impression seal (embosser) in addition to the rubber stamp seal, but not in place of it. If you choose to use an impression seal, your name should be correct and the seal should contain the words, "Notary Public-State of Florida."  
    
- Before using your notary seal, examine the seal to ensure that all information is correct.  
    
- Keep your seal in a secure location to avoid its loss or misuse.  
    
- If your notary seal is lost, misplaced, or stolen, you are required to notify the Department of State (or the Governor's Notary Section) in writing. You should include your commission name and number, date of birth, and the last date the seal was in your possession. Additionally, if your seal was stolen, you should file a report with your local law enforcement agency. Please refer to Q & A section for instructions when an employer keeps your notary seal.

### **Notary Fees**

- Florida authorizes notaries to charge up to $10 for each notarial act administering an oath, taking an acknowledgment, attesting to a photocopy, verifying a VIN, or certifying the contents of a safe-deposit box.  
    
- Notaries may charge up to $20 to solemnize marriage (perform a marriage ceremony).  
    
- Fees are optional. Be reasonable when setting fees.  
    
- If you charge fees for other services not directly related to your notary services, you should provide your customer with an itemized list of charges beforehand.  
    
- If you are a government employee whose commission fees were paid by your employer for the purpose of notarizing during work hours, please review the information on Government Employees as Notaries.

Remember, notary fees are considered income and should be reported when filing annual income taxes.

## **Authentication of Notarized Documents by the Secretary of State**

On October 5, 1961, representatives from a group of nations met at The Hague in Holland to discuss various issues pertaining to international law. Out of that meeting came an international treaty known as the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents. More than 60 countries have joined the Convention, including the United States.

Documents that are notarized and sent to another country require verification or legalization of the notary's signature and official capacity prior to acceptance by the receiving country. The Hague Convention agreement simplifies the process by allowing the attachment of a single verifying certificate called an Apostille (a French word meaning "note"). The Apostille entitles the document to full recognition in the country of intended use, and no further authentication or legalization by the Embassy or Consulate of that country is required.

Each country, or subdivision of that country, has a designated official who is responsible for authenticating notarized documents. The treaty provides a list of officials in the United States with the authority to issue such certifications. In most states (47 out of 50), that authority is vested in the Secretary of State, or one or more of his or her deputies or assistants. Since the treaty came into force for the United States in October 1981, the Florida Secretary of State has been responsible for providing Apostilles for documents notarized in Florida and sent to another country. Revisions to the notary law, effective January 1, 1992, reaffirmed this authority. Section 117.103, Florida Statutes, provides:

> _Upon the receipt of a written request, the notarized document, and a fee of $10 payable to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State shall provide a certificate of notarial authority. Documents destined for countries participating in an International Treaty called the Hague Convention require an Apostille, and that requirement shall be determined by the Secretary of State._

Documents being sent to another state or a country not participating in the Hague Convention may also require certification. In that case, a Certificate of Notarial Authority is issued by the Secretary of State.

A notary public is not responsible for requesting an Apostille or a Certificate of Notarial Authority. Rather, according to the treaty, the person who signed the document or the document bearer may request authentication of documents. In order to provide that certification, the Department of State will need the following information:

- A written request for the Apostille or Certificate, stating the country or state to which the document will be sent. The Department of State will determine which authentication is appropriate for the receiving country.  
    
- The original notarized document. The notarization must fully comply with the requirements of Florida law, or the document will be returned for correction.  
    
- A check (drawn on an American bank) or a money order for $10 per certificate, made payable to the Secretary of State.

Mail the request, notarized document, and payment to:

**Department of State  
Division of Corporations  
P.O. Box 6327  
Tallahassee, FL 32314  
**

The Secretary of State will also provide an Apostille or Certificate for the following Florida documents: birth certificates and death certificates bearing the original signature of the State Registrar; vehicle titles certified by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles; corporation documents bearing the signature of the Secretary of State; and documents certified by any Clerk of the Court for any county in Florida (the fee for an Apostille on any county-certified document is $20).

Documents in proper order with correct notarizations sent to the Department of State are usually processed within 10 working days and are returned by regular mail to the sender or forwarded to an address given by the sender. For additional information, please contact the Department of State at (850) 245-6945.



## Duties

**Notaries are authorized by law to perform six basic duties:**

- Administer oaths or affirmations  
    
- Take acknowledgments  
    
- Attest to photocopies of certain documents  
    
- Solemnize marriage  
    
- Verify vehicle identification numbers (VINs)  
    
- Certify the contents of a safe-deposit box

Each of these duties is explained in detail in the following.

**Understanding Oaths and Acknowledgments**

The Governor's Notary Section answers hundreds of telephone inquiries every week regarding the notary law and proper notarial procedures. In talking with notaries, it is surprising how many of them do not understand the basic act of "notarizing a signature." Many incorrectly assume that they are just verifying identification and witnessing a signature. But, the act of notarization is much different.

When you notarize a signature, you must perform one of two official notarial acts: take an acknowledgment from or administer an oath (or affirmation) to the document signer. These two acts have different purposes. The lack of understanding of these basic duties causes confusion and often leads to errors in notarizations, even among the most experienced notaries.

To take an acknowledgment, the document signer must personally appear before you, the notary public, and declare that he or she has signed the document voluntarily. You should ensure that the signer understands the document and has not been coerced into signing. If there is any question about the signer's willingness to execute the document or his or her understanding of the contents of the document, you should refuse to notarize and perhaps refer the person to an attorney for legal advice. You may want to ask the signer, "Do you acknowledge that this is your signature and that you are executing this document of your own free will?" If the answer is yes, you should then complete a certificate which states that the execution of the document was acknowledged by the signer. Documents typically requiring an acknowledgment include deeds, mortgages, contracts, and powers of attorney (except those pertaining to motor vehicle titles).

An oath or affirmation is administered to a document signer when the signer is required to make a sworn statement about certain facts. The signer personally appears before you to swear (or affirm) to you, an officer duly appointed to administer oaths, that the information contained in the document is true. A person who makes a false oath or affirmation is subject to criminal charges for perjury. Sworn statements are commonly used in affidavits, depositions, and applications.

A notarization requiring an oath begins with the administration of an oath or affirmation. The courts have held that there should be a verbal exchange between the notary and the document signer in which the signer indicates that he or she is taking an oath. An oath similar to one administered in court by a judge or bailiff would be sufficient. Or, you may simply ask, "Do you swear (or affirm) that the information contained in this document is true?" After receiving an affirmative answer, you must complete a proper notarial certificate indicating that an oath or affirmation was taken.

If the document you are asked to notarize contains a prepared notarial certificate, look for the key words "acknowledged" or "sworn to" to tell you which notarial act is required. If there is no notarial certificate on the document, the signer must direct you whether he or she wants to make an acknowledgment or take an oath. Unless you are an attorney, you are not authorized to advise a person which notarial act is appropriate for the document presented for notarization, and you may not advise the person about the contents of the document.

In order to correctly perform the duties of your office, you need to understand what it means to "notarize a signature" and the difference between the acknowledgment and the oath.

> **_NOTE:_** _The form certificates used when taking an acknowledgment or administering an oath are found in the notary law, section 117.05(13), Florida Statutes._

**Affidavits**

An affidavit is a common form of sworn statement requiring an oath. Below is the standard form of  
affidavit. Please note that the affiant is the person making the sworn statement.

**AFFIDAVIT**

_**![](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/images/affidavit.gif)**_

**Depositions**

A deposition is the testimony of a witness, under oath or affirmation, taken outside of court in which lawyers ask oral questions of the witness. The testimony is usually reduced to writing and duly authenticated and is intended to be used in a trial of a civil action or a criminal prosecution. The person giving the testimony is called the deponent..

Notaries are authorized to administer an oath for a deposition for use in a court case or an investigation. When administering the oath, the notary must require the deponent's physical presence and properly identify him or her. If the notary keeps a journal or record of notarial acts, the journal entry should be made at this point, including the deponent's signature. The notary would then administer the oath or affirmation, perhaps by having the deponent raise his or her right hand and asking:

> _"Do you swear (or affirm) that the testimony you are about to give in this matter is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth (so help you, God)?"_

Once an affirmative answer is given, the deponent is now under oath, and the notary's responsibility is over.

Although depositions may be taken over the telephone, the deponent must be in the physical presence of the notary public, or other official authorized to administer oaths, at the time the oath or affirmation is given. There is no exception to the presence requirement, even if the attorneys for both parties stipulate otherwise. (See Attorney General Opinion, No. 92-95, December 23, 1992.) This means that, if you are asked to swear in a person over the phone, you must decline. A notary, or other authorized official, would have to be present with the deponent for the administration of the oath or affirmation.

When asked to make a written certificate of the notarial act, we suggest that you make a certificate in substantially the form provided below.

![](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/images/depositi.gif)

You should also know that, as a notary public, you are not authorized to take a deposition. That is, you may not actively participate in questioning a witness who is giving a deposition in a criminal or civil proceeding. A Florida appellate court recently ruled that the taking of a deposition constitutes the practice of law under section 454.23, Florida Statutes. Notaries who are not licensed attorneys are prohibited from engaging in the practice of law and may be suspended from office by the Governor for such violation.

The referenced case involved two paralegals, one of whom was a notary public, who owned a business that performed paralegal functions. Neither was a licensed attorney, but both readily admitted their active participation in several depositions. In its opinion, the Court explained:

> _A deposition is an important, formal, recorded proceeding in which lawyers must observe the Florida rules of court and must rely on their legal training and skills to question witnesses effectively. The activities and services involved in participating in a deposition often implicate ethical questions and strategic considerations of the utmost importance. The effectiveness of the person deposing a witness can have a significant impact on whether objectionable information is identified and addressed or waived, whether a case is made, and how the evidence therefrom is used in any subsequent legal proceeding . . . Without a doubt, the process of directly examining or cross-examining a witness can affect important rights under the law . . . We conclude that, lacking adequate legal training, a nonattorney participating in the examination of a witness poses the very dangers of incompetent, unethical, or irresponsible representation . . . we hold that the nonlawyer appellees' active participation in questioning witnesses in depositions . . . constitutes the unauthorized practice of law in violation of section 454.23, Florida Statutes._

The notary involved has been denied a renewal appointment by the Governor's Office and both persons have pending criminal charges for the unlicensed practice law. Be careful that you do not overstep your authority when asked to swear in a person for a deposition. The unauthorized practice of law is a serious matter and one that is not taken lightly by the Governor's Office or the Court.

**_Note:_** _For additional information on the court case, see State v. Foster, 674 So.2d 747 (Fla. 1st DCA 1996)._

[**Back to top**](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/chapters/duties.asp#top)

**Attesting to Photocopies**

In Florida, notaries are authorized to attest to the trueness of photocopies of certain documents. Although commonly known as certified photocopies, the notary law refers to these documents as attested photocopies. A notary public may make attested photocopies if the following criteria, found in section 117.05(12) of the Florida Statutes, are satisfied.

- The document must be an original document. A notary public cannot make an attested photocopy from a photocopy, or from another certified copy.
- The document cannot be a public record, certified copies of which are available from another public official. If a certified copy can be obtained from the official source, then the notary public should decline the request.
- The making of the photocopy must be supervised by the notary public. It is not sufficient for the notary public to compare the photocopy with the original document. The notary public must actually make the photocopy or supervise another person while he or she makes the photocopy.

After making (or supervising the making of) the photocopy, the notary should complete a notarial certificate in substantially the same form as prescribed by law.

![](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/images/photocpy.gif)

This notarial certificate should be typed, stamped or written on the front or back of the photocopy or may be attached as a separate page.

One of the most often asked questions concerning attested photocopies is whether a particular document is a public record. Notaries must make a determination about this question before attesting to the trueness of any photocopy. The following documents are examples of public records, copies of which cannot be attested to by a notary:

- Birth certificate
- Marriage certificate
- Death certificate
- Certificate of citizenship or naturalization
- Documents filed in a court proceeding
- Documents recorded by the Clerk of the Court
- Public records maintained in government offices
- Student records (transcripts, etc.) kept in public education offices
- Federal or state income tax forms, already filed
- Professional licenses issued by the State of Florida
- Any document for which photocopying is prohibited

This is not a complete list of public records. If the document is issued by a government entity, the notary should contact that entity to determine whether a certified copy is available. If one is available, then the notary public must decline to make an attested photocopy. Additionally, the notary should ask the person if the document has been filed in a court proceeding or in the official records at the courthouse.

The following documents can be photocopied from the original (if not officially filed or recorded) and attested to by a notary, because certified copies cannot be obtained from another public official:

- Florida driver's license
- Florida vehicle title
- Social Security card
- Diploma
- Medical record
- U.S. passport
- Bill of sale
- Contract
- Lease
- Resident alien card
- Personal letter

The maximum fee a notary may charge for making an attested photocopy is $10.

**Solemnizing Marriage**

Florida is one of only three states which authorize notaries public to perform marriage ceremonies. The following guidelines should be helpful.

**Procedure**

- The couple must obtain a valid Florida marriage license from a county court judge or clerk of the circuit court and present it to the notary public before the marriage ceremony.  
    
- The notary public performs the marriage ceremony. An example of a simple, civil ceremony is printed below. It may be personalized, and the bride and groom may even exchange their own vows. But, the couple's vows must reflect their intentions to make a legally binding commitment to each other.  
    
- The notary public is responsible for making a certificate on the appropriate portion of the marriage license and returning it to the office of the county court judge or clerk of the circuit court which issued the license within 10 days after solemnizing the marriage. § 741.08, Fla. Stat.

**General Information**

- A Florida notary public may perform a marriage ceremony only within the geographical boundaries of this state.  
    
- A notary public may charge up to $20 for solemnizing the rites of matrimony. §§ 117.045 & 28.24 (29), Fla. Stat.  
    
- A notary public may perform a marriage ceremony for a person who is related to him or her by blood or marriage. The prohibition against notarizing the signature of a spouse, son, daughter, mother, or father does not apply because the notary is not notarizing the signature of the bride and groom, but is only certifying that the couple have been joined in marriage by the notary according to the laws of the State of Florida. Op. Att'y Gen. Fla. 91-70 (1991).  
    
- The notary should check the expiration date of the license to ensure that the license is still valid. The notary should also require identification if the bride and groom are not personally known.  
    
- It is recommended that two witnesses, other than the notary, sign the marriage certificate in the event that proof of the marriage ceremony is necessary in the future.

Additional information about solemnizing marriage is located in the Q&A section.

**Verifying a VIN**

Florida law requires that, when applying for a Florida title for the first time on a used motor vehicle, the owner must sign a sworn statement that the vehicle identification number (VIN) and the odometer reading on the vehicle are correct.

Additionally, a physical inspection of the vehicle must be done by an authorized person to certify the VIN. Notaries public are included in the list of persons authorized to certify this information. § 319.23(3)(a)(2), Fla. Stat.  

A form prepared by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, HSMV 82042 (Rev. 5/95)S, is used for this purpose.

![](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/IMAGES/DHMV.GIF)

Part A requires the owner's sworn statement regarding the correct VIN and odometer reading. A jurat, or notarial certificate, is provided in this section. The notary should make sure that the information in Part A is complete prior to the notarization.

Part B requires the notary public, or other authorized person, to certify that he or she has physically inspected the vehicle and found the VIN to be identical to the number recorded on the form. The notary public must include the date, sign the document, print his or her name, and affix his or her notary seal.

This VIN verification form is also found on the Application for Certificate of Title With/Without Registration, HSMV 82040 (Rev. 5/96)S. These forms and all other forms related to vehicle registration are available from the tag office of the Tax Collector's Office in each county.

**Certifying the Contents of a  
Safe-Deposit Box**

Florida law provides that a financial institution may open a safe-deposit box if the rental fee is past due, providing that proper notice has been made and that certain other conditions are met. A notary public is authorized and required to be present for the opening of the safe-deposit box, to inventory the contents of the vault, and to make an appropriate certificate of the opening. The notary is not required to estimate the value of the contents of the safe-deposit box.

As with other notarial acts, the maximum fee a notary may charge for performing the authorized duties at the opening of a safe-deposit box is $10.  
  
The law authorizing notaries to perform this function became effective on July 3, 1992, and is found in section 655.94(1), Florida Statutes.

**Procedure for the Notary Public**

- The notary must be present at the time the safe-deposit box is opened and may not be a director, officer, employee, or stockholder of the financial institution. An officer of the institution must also be present with the notary at the opening of the safe-deposit box.  
    
- When the safe-deposit box is opened, the notary should inventory the contents of the box and should complete a certificate reciting the name of the lessee, the date of the opening, and a list of the contents. Florida law does not provide a form certificate; however, the following form, prepared by the Notary Section, should be sufficient.

- Once the certificate is completed, copies should be made. The notary should place the original certificate in a package with the contents of the safe-deposit box and seal the package. The notary must then write on the outside of the package the name of the lessee and the date of the opening.  
    
- The notary should leave the sealed package and a copy of the certificate with the financial institution.  
    
- If the notary keeps a record book or journal of notarial acts, details of the act should be recorded. It may be a good idea to require the person opening the box, the officer of the institution, and any other witness to sign the journal as well.

**

> **(Grounds for Suspension)**

The State Constitution authorizes the Governor to suspend a notary public from office for "malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty, drunkenness, incompetence, permanent inability to perform his official duties, or commission of a felony." s.7, Art. IV, Fla. Const.

> **_Subsection 117.01(4) of the Florida Statutes provides:_**

The Governor may suspend a notary public for any of the grounds provided in s. 7, Art. IV of the State Constitution. Grounds constituting malfeasance, misfeasance, or neglect of duty include, but are not limited to, the following:

> (a) A material false statement on the application.
> 
> (b) A complaint found to have merit by the Governor.
> 
> (c) Failure to cooperate or respond to an investigation by the Governor's Office or the Department of State regarding a complaint.

> 
> (j) Failure to maintain the bond required.

**Civil Penalty**

_Section 117.107(9) of the Florida Statutes provides in part:_

A notary public may not notarize a signature on a document if the person whose signature is being notarized is not in the presence of the notary public at the time the signature is notarized. Any notary public who violates this paragraph is guilty of a civil infraction, punishable by penalty not exceeding $5,000, and that conduct constitutes malfeasance and misfeasance in the conduct of official duties. It is no defense to the civil infraction specified in this paragraph that the notary public acted without intent to defraud. A notary public who violates this paragraph with the intent to defraud is guilty of violating s.117.105.

**Criminal Penalties**

- No person shall obtain or use a notary public commission in other than his legal name, and it is unlawful for a notary public to notarize his own signature. Any person applying for a notary public commission must submit proof of his identity to the Department of State if so requested. Any person who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 s 775.083, or s. 775.084. § 117.05(1).  
    
- Any person who acts as or otherwise willfully impersonates a notary public while not lawfully appointed and commissioned to perform notarial acts is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. § 117.05(7).

### **Don't Notarize Photographs**

Occasionally, you may be asked to "notarize" a photograph. Please be aware that certifying or notarizing photographs is not an authorized notarial act under Florida law.

You may, however, notarize a person's signature on a written statement concerning the photograph. For example, if John Doe wants to certify that the person in a particular photograph is John Doe, he could sign a sworn written statement stating that the photograph is of John Doe. You could then notarize his signature on that statement in the same way that you notarize any sworn written statement. His statement could be made on the back of the photograph or on a separate paper to be attached to the photograph.

Keep in mind that you should not certify or attest that the person in the photograph is John Doe. Rather, you should certify that the statement concerning the photograph was signed and sworn to in your presence by John Doe. This is accomplished by using the standard notarial certificate (jurat) provided in the Florida Statutes for oaths. Remember, you should never apply your notary seal to and sign any document without completing a proper notarial certificate.

## **Don't Provide Certified Copies of  
Birth Certificates**

The Notary Section continues to receive numerous inquiries about certifying copies of birth certificates. A notary public may NOT make a certified photocopy of a birth certificate, whether it was issued in Florida, another state, or a foreign country. Birth certificates are official records and certified copies may be obtained from the public official who is the custodian of the records.

The typical problem arises when a person is leaving the country within a few days and is required by his or her travel agency to have a "notarized" birth certificate. The word "notarized" immediately sends the person to a notary public. Actually, a person should obtain a "certified" copy of his or her birth certificate, rather than a "notarized" copy. Notaries should decline to certify or notarize these documents for two reasons.

First, a notary public may not attest to the trueness of a photocopy of a public record if a copy can be made by another public official. The Florida Department of Health retains vital records such as birth certificates, death certificates, marriage licenses, and certain divorce records. The Department produces certified copies of these documents when requested by an authorized person.

Second, a notary public may only attest to the trueness of a photocopy of an original document. Most people do not possess their original birth certificate; they only have a certified copy.

Additionally, Florida law prohibits even the photocopying of birth certificates. This would eliminate the alternative procedure of attaching an affidavit to a photocopy of a birth certificate in which a party swears that the photocopy is a true copy of the birth certificate.

Officials at the Bureau of Vital Statistics in Jacksonville, where Florida vital records are housed, report that birth certificates and other vital records are available from their office and may be available for the last 30 years from the county health department in most counties in Florida. The Jacksonville office takes orders by telephone using a major credit card for payment and even offers express or overnight delivery for an additional fee. It is best, of course, to request such records in writing allowing 2-3 weeks for delivery.  
  
If you are requested to make a certified copy of a birth certificate, or other vital record, please decline and refer the party to the public office holding that record. If the document is a Florida vital record, the party may go to the county health department or write to:

**Department of Health  
Bureau of Vital Statistics  
Vital Records Section  
1217 Pearl Street  
Jacksonville, Florida 32202**

For telephone orders or additional information, the party may call the Jacksonville office at (904) 359-6931 [](http://voice.google.com/calls?a=nc,%2B19043596931 "Call +1 904-359-6931 via Google Voice")or (904) 359-6912[](http://voice.google.com/calls?a=nc,%2B19043596912 "Call +1 904-359-6912 via Google Voice").

## **Don't Notarize Blank Documents**

Apparently, it is a common practice for people to sign a blank power of attorney form to facilitate the sale of a motor vehicle. Notaries should be careful not to notarize incomplete documents.

Many notarized blank forms have been found at car dealerships by DMV investigators and are often presented to officials at U.S. Customs in Miami. According to officials at these agencies, incomplete forms will not be accepted, and if notarized, they will be presented to the State Attorney's Office and to the Governor's Office for investigation and appropriate action.

## Notaries in special positions
## **Government Employees as Notaries Public**

A government agency, i.e., state, county, or municipal, is authorized to pay the cost of securing a notary commission for one or more of its employees. Such cost is deemed to be an expense of the agency. See sections 116.35 and 116.36, Florida Statutes.

Based upon research and interpretation of the applicable laws, the following statements reflect the position of the Governor's Notary Section regarding government employees who are notaries:

- Although the government agency pays for the commission, it is the employee who is the appointed notary public, not the agency. Such employee-notary is a notary public 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for the entire 4-year term of appointment, unless the notary dies, resigns, or is suspended or removed from office by the Governor or the Florida Senate.  
    
- The government agency may set regulations regarding the use of the notary's commission during the employee-notary's regular business hours.  
    
- All fees collected by the employee-notary for notary services rendered during business hours belong to the government agency, pursuant to sections 116.35, 116.38. The government agency has the authority to set the notary fees to be charged by that agency for its notary services to the public, but such fees may not exceed the allowable fees specified in Chapter 117, Florida Statutes.  
    
- The employee-notary may perform notarial acts outside his employment and may charge fees for those notary services not exceeding the fees set by law. Such fees belong to the notary public. See sections 117.05(2), 117.045, and 28.24(29).  
    
- The notary seal, the notary commission certificate, and any other papers belonging to the notary public, i.e., a record book or journal of notarial acts, are the property of the notary public. These items are not the property of the government agency, even if the agency paid for such items. Even upon termination of employment, these items belong to the notary public. It is the notary's responsibility to secure the notary seal to prevent its misuse. Any unauthorized use of a notary seal by a person who is not the lawfully commissioned notary public is a criminal offense. It is also unlawful for a person to possess a notary seal or commission certificate when that person is not the lawfully commissioned notary public. See sections 117.05(7) and (8).  
    
- Both the employee-notary and the government agency are liable for all notarial acts performed by the employee-notary within the scope of his or her employment, pursuant to section 117.05(6).  
    
- The government agency is not liable for notarial acts performed by the employee-notary outside his normal employment responsibilities.  
    
- Upon termination of employment by the employee-notary, the government agency's liability for notarial acts performed in the future by the former employee-notary also terminates. However, the government agency may always be held liable for any notarial acts performed by the employee-notary during his or her period of employment.  
    
- When the employee-notary terminates employment with the government agency, the government agency does not have the authority to request, nor require, the resignation of the employee-notary from the office of notary public. The notary public was appointed by the Governor, and only the Governor may request or require the resignation of a notary.

## **Law Enforcement Officers as Notaries**

Florida law provides that certain law enforcement officers or correctional officers may act as notaries in some instances. These officers are limited in what they are authorized to do in fact, they may only administer oaths "when engaged in the performance of official duties." See §117.10, Florida Statutes. For example, if they are conducting an investigation, they may take sworn statements from witnesses.  
  
This law is applicable to the following officers:

- Law enforcement officers  
    
- Correctional officers  
    
- Correctional probation officers  
    
- Traffic accident investigation officers  
    
- Traffic infraction enforcement officers

See sections 943.10 and 316.640, Florida Statutes, for definitions of these officers.

The law does not authorize these officers to take acknowledgments, to make attested photocopies, or to solemnize marriage, nor are they permitted to notarize their own signatures. Additionally, these officers do not have to apply for appointment, obtain the required notary bond, use a notary seal, or complete notarial certificates.

## **Military Officers as Notaries Public**

Florida law authorizes certain commissioned military officers to administer oaths and take acknowledgments. §§92.51 & 695.031, Fla. Stat. However, the power given to these military officers is limited. They are authorized to "notarize signatures" when documents must be executed by persons also serving in the Armed Forces. These officers are not notaries public they are only authorized to perform the two most common notarial acts.

The military officer must be on active duty serving in or with the United States Armed Forces, including the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or any component of one of these, and must be above the rank of second lieutenant or higher in the Army, Air Force or Marine Corps, or ensign or higher in the Navy or Coast Guard.  

The person whose signature is to be "notarized" by taking the oath or making the acknowledgment must also be a member of the United States Armed Forces and be serving on active duty. The military officer may also notarize the signature of the spouse of such military personnel, or the signature of a person whose duties require his or her presence with the Armed Forces.

As required for notaries, the military officer is required to prove the identity of the document signer, although no specific form of identification is specified by law. He or she must personally know the document signer or have "satisfactory proof" of the person's identity. §695.09, Fla. Stat.

The military officer is not required to use a seal.

When performing a notarial act, the military officer is not bound by geographical boundaries, as is the notary public. The notarization may take place "within or without the United States." This allows military personnel serving outside the United States, and their spouses, to execute their documents without having to find a notary public in a foreign country or appear before a consul or embassy official.

Documents properly executed in the presence of a military officer in the manner prescribed by law are entitled to recording in Florida.

Although not required, it is recommended that the military officers print or type their name below their signature and provide their service or serial number for identification purposes. §695.25, Fla. Stat. No venue, or location of the notarial act, is required but, again, adding this information is recommended.

Certain federal law and military regulations also govern the authority of military officers to act as notaries public. More specific information can be obtained from a military legal assistance office.

_The following certificate is provided in Florida law for use by a military officer when performing these special notarizations._

## Skipped

## Notarizing in special Circumstances 
Occasionally you may be asked to perform a notarization that requires special handling. For example, how do you notarize if the document signer is blind? Cannot speak English? Has a disability? In any special situation, you should make every effort to accommodate the person's request. If you are unsure about the notarization, though, you should decline to notarize.

Florida law addresses some of these situations, but not all. There are, however, some commonly accepted practices for unusual notarizations. As with any other notarization, you must rely upon the law, exercise reasonable care, and use your common sense. You may also want to note the special circumstances of the notarization in the notarial certificate and in your journal (if you keep one).

Remember, unless you are an attorney, you may not give legal advice when you provide notary services. That means you are prohibited from advising the signer which notarial act is required for his or her document, from preparing legal documents, or from explaining the contents or legal effects of a document.

If you believe that the person does not fully understand the document he or she is to sign, you should decline to notarize and suggest that the person seek legal advice from a competent attorney.

**For a person who is mentally incapacitated**

_§117.05(14)(a), Fla. Stat.  
_  
The law prohibits you from notarizing the signature of a person who you know has been adjudicated mentally incapacitated by a court of competent jurisdiction if that notarization pertains to a right that has been removed. These rights refer to such things as the right to vote, to marry, to execute conveyances of real property, etc.

What if the person is usually mentally competent, but is medicated at the time of the notarization, or what if a family member says the person is "in and out" of lucidity due to Alzheimer's disease or some other mentally debilitating ailment?

When performing any notarization, you should question the signer to determine that he or she is willing and competent to execute the document. The following suggestions may be helpful:

- You may want to have an impartial witness for the notarization.  
    
- If you are asked to go to a hospital or nursing home to provide services, check with the patient's nurse or doctor prior to notarization.  
    
- Talk to the person alone. Ask questions unrelated to the notarization. Ask for his name, home address, and telephone number. You could also engage the person in a conversation about his family, his occupation, a television program, a recent news event, etc.  
    
- Ask the signer to tell you about the document to be notarized. What kind of document do you need to sign? Have you read the document completely? Do you understand the document? Do you need someone to explain the contents of the document to you? Has anyone pressured you to sign this document?  
    
- If you feel the person is mentally competent at the time, proceed. If in doubt, don't do it!  
    
- If you keep a record of your notarial acts, document the special circumstances of this notarization even if you must refuse to notarize.  
    
- Have the witness sign your journal.

[**Back to top**](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/chapters/special.asp#top)

**For a Person who is Blind**

_§117.107(5), Fla. Stat._

- The law requires you to read the document to the document signer before the notarization.  
    
- You may wish to add a statement in your notarial certificate that you have complied with this requirement of the law: "I further certify that I read the document to (name of signer) prior to notarization."  
    
- Unless you are an attorney, you cannot advise the person about the contents of the document; however, you may re-read any portion of the document to the person.

**For a Person Who Does Not Speak English**

_§117.107(6), Fla. Stat._

- The nature and effect of the document must be translated into a language that the person does understand. The law does not specify that a written translation is required; therefore, an oral translation is sufficient.  
    
- You may wish to add a statement in your notarial certificate that you have complied with this requirement of the law: "I further certify that the nature and effect of the document was translated for (name of signer) by (name of translator) prior to notarization."  
    
- You may also want the translator to sign the document and your journal.

**For a Person Who is Deaf**

- The obvious problem that exists in this situation is communication. Unless you and the signer are competent in sign language or lip reading, you should communicate with the person by writing notes.  
    
- Make additional comments about the notarization in your journal entry.

**For a Person Who is Signing a Document Written in a Foreign Language Not Understood by the Notary**

Remember, you are not responsible for the contents of the document, but you need to exercise caution in this situation. Follow these recommendations:

- Make sure that you can communicate verbally with the document signer or that a qualified, trustworthy translator is present.  
    
- Determine, if possible, that the document is complete.  
    
- Check the document for a notarial certificate. If the document does not have a notarial certificate, ask the document signer for instructions. If he directs you which notarial act is appropriate for his document, proceed by adding the correct certificate and completing the notarization. If he does not know, refuse to notarize.  
    
- Complete the notarial certificate in English. The certificate may be translated into the language of the document, but the translated certificate should not be signed and sealed by the notary.  
    
- If you are unsure about the notarization, you should refuse to notarize.

[**Back to top**](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/chapters/special.asp#top)

**For a Person Who is Illiterate**

- Although not required by law, you should read the document to the document signer before the notarization.  
    
- You may wish to add a statement in your notarial certificate: "I further certify that I read the document to (name of signer) prior to notarization."  
    
- Unless you are an attorney, you cannot advise the person about the contents of the document, however, you may reread any portion of the document to the person.

**For a Person Who Signs by Mark**

Occasionally, you may be asked to notarize the signature of a person who signs with a mark. The person may be illiterate or may have a physical disability which prohibits him or her from signing in the customary manner. The notary laws do not require any additional procedures for notarizing in these situations. You may notarize in the same manner as for usual signatures. However, you may prefer to take extra precautions. The following guidelines may be helpful.

- Question the signer to make sure that he or she understands the nature and effect of the document to be signed. If the person is illiterate, read the document to him or her. If the person does not understand, refer him or her to an attorney for legal advice and do not proceed with the notarization.  
    
- Ask for proper identification.  
    
- Perform the appropriate notarial act: administer an oath or take an acknowledgment.  
    
- Before the person signs the document, print his or her first name at the beginning of the signature line and the last name at the end of the line. Just below the line, print the words "His Mark" or "Her Mark".

![](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/images/X.GIF)

Then, ask the person to make his or her mark on the designated line.

- Complete the notarial certificate with all the required information. When filling in the person's name whose signature is being notarized, you may want to indicate that the person signed by way of mark.  
    
- It is also recommended that two uninterested persons witness the signing of the document and the notarization and that their names and addresses be clearly printed under their signatures.  
    
- Make appropriate comments in your journal.

**For a Person with a Disability Who Directs Another to Sign**

On a rare occasion, you may be asked to notarize the signature of a person who cannot sign a document in the usual manner. An individual with a disability may direct another person to sign on his or her behalf. See _State v. Hickman_, 180 So.2d 254 (1966). In a sense, one person substitutes his hands for the hands of the person with a disability. You may notarize this signature but you should indicate the unusual circumstances in the notarial certificate. Although the notary laws do not provide specific guidelines for this situation, you may want to take extra precautions to prevent any problems. The following guidelines may be helpful.

- Question the person to make sure that he or she understands the nature and effect of the document to be signed. If the person is blind, read the entire document to him or her. If the person does not understand, refer him or her to an attorney for legal advice and do not proceed with the notarization.  
    
- Ask for proper identification from the person with a disability. It is not necessary to require identification from the designated signer. Think of that person only as the "hands" of the person with a disability.  
    
- The designated person may then sign the signature of the person with a disability at the direction of and in the presence of that person.  
    
- Perform the appropriate notarial act: administer an oath or take an acknowledgment. Your notarial act should be directed to the person with a disability, rather than the designated signer.  
    
- Complete the notarial certificate with the required information. When stating whose signature is being notarized, it would be best to indicate the special circumstances of the signing.  
    
- It is also recommended that two persons, with no interest in the transaction, witness the signing of the document and the notarization and that their names and addresses be clearly printed below their signatures. Unless otherwise required by law for the particular document, it is not necessary for the witnesses' signatures to be notarized.  
    
- Be sure to get the witnesses and the designated signer to sign your journal and make appropriate notes.

For an oath:  
![](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/images/disoath.gif)

For an acknowledgment:  
![](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/images/ack.gif)

**For a Person Signing with Power of Attorney**

- Situation: John Doe presents a document to be signed by Nancy Smith. John Doe state that he has power of attorney for Nancy Smith. John Doe signs the document in one of two ways:  
      
    (1) _John Doe as attorney-in-fact for Nancy Smith_(2) _Nancy Smith by John Doe, attorney-in-fact_

The first way is the preferred method.

- It is not the notary's responsibility to ensure that the signer has power of attorney. The person states he has that authority and indicates this fact when he signs just accept his word.

> **_Note:_** _If you are notarizing in connection with your employment, you may need to require a copy of the POA for your employer's files._

- Note the capacity of the signer in the notarial certificate. Use a notarial certificate in substantially the same form as the one for an acknowledgment in a representative capacity.

**For a Person Who is a Minor**

Have you ever been asked to notarize the signature of a person under the age of 18? If so, you may have considered this request a "major" problem. No doubt you have had some of the same questions that we are frequently asked.

- **May I notarize the signature of a minor?** Generally speaking, you may notarize for a minor; however, all of the requirements of the notary laws must be followed.  
    
- **Is there an age limit?** The notary laws do not limit notarizations based upon a person's age.

> The Governor's Notary Section recommends that you exercise caution when notarizing for a minor. In particular, you should determine whether the minor understands the nature of an oath or acknowledgment before notarizing.
> 
> For example, a woman recently called our office to ask whether she could notarize the signature of a 4-year-old child. The father wanted to transfer the title of a boat to his child. A child of this young age would probably not understand the transaction. On the other hand, we recently encountered a situation involving a 12-year-old child who wanted to submit a sworn statement to the court regarding an incident that she witnessed. She actually wrote down what she had seen and wanted to sign her statement and swear to it in the presence of a notary. Most likely, a 12-year-old child would understand the act of swearing to the truthfulness of a statement.
> 
> In these types of situations, the notary should question the child to make sure that he or she understands the nature of an oath or an acknowledgment. The notary should also determine that the child is not being pressured or coerced to sign the document.
> 
> When a child is too young to comprehend the transaction, a parent sometimes signs on behalf of the child. If you are asked to notarize in that situation, it is the parent's signature that is to be notarized, not the child's.

- **What about identification for a minor?** Any time you notarize a signature, the signer, including a minor, must provide acceptable identification to the notary. The problem, of course, is that most minors do not have one of the forms of acceptable identification listed in the Florida Statutes. There are two possible solutions.

> First, you may be interested to know that any person 12 years of age or older may be issued a state identification card. To obtain the card, the person should apply at the local Division of Motor Vehicles office where driver's licenses are issued.  
>   
> Second, you may use the sworn written statement of a credible witness to identify the minor. (Please refer to page 33 for a full explanation of this method of identification.)

When asked to notarize the signature of a minor, you may refuse to do so if you are unsure about any aspect of the notarization. In unusual situations, you may even suggest that the minor or his or her parent or guardian see an attorney.

## Liability and RecordKeeping 
## Notary and Employer Liability

Although as a notary you are bonded, you may be held personally liable for any misconduct or negligence in the performance of your official duties. This means that you could be sued if an improper notarization causes loss to another individual or company. However, if you perform your duties correctly and carefully, always exercising reasonable care, you probably don't have to worry about being sued.

> _"Reasonable care" is that degree of care which a person of ordinary prudence and intelligence would exercise in the same or similar circumstances. Failure to exercise such care is negligence._

Florida law provides that the notary's employer may also be held liable if the notarization in question was done within the scope of the notary's employment. See §117.05(6), Florida Statutes. A government agency may or may not be held liable for the misconduct of their employee-notaries depending on the circumstances and the laws governing such issues. Please read page 24 for additional information on government employees as notaries.

The best protection for you and your employer against a lawsuit or a claim filed against your notary bond is simple:

- Know the laws governing your duties.
- Use reasonable care in notarizing.
- Don't make any exceptions.
- Keep accurate records.

**Keeping Records of Your Notarial Acts:  
The Notary Journal**

Notaries are not authorized to keep copies of the documents they notarize. The best way to protect yourself is to document your notarial acts in a journal (record book or log).

Florida law does not require the use of a notary journal; however, you may be interested to know that the Governor's Task Force on Notaries Public in 1989 recommended the mandatory use of journals. Although the Legislature did not follow that recommendation, many notaries in Florida are beginning to voluntarily use a journal. You may want to consider this option as well. Each time you perform a notarial act you should record the event your journal.

Numerous notary journals are available on the market today, and they all have similar features. We recommend that your journal be bound (not loose-leaf) and have consecutively numbered pages, so that a page could not be removed without being detected. Important information should be recorded in the journal including:

- the date of the notarial act;
- the type of notarial act: oath, acknowledgment, attested photocopy, marriage;
- the name or brief description of the document;
- the party's printed name, exactly as he or she signed the document;
- the party's address;
- the party's signature;
- the type of identification relied upon in identifying the party, including the serial number, expiration date, date of birth, etc.;
- the fee charged for the notary service; and
- any additional comments you consider important; for example, the person is blind and you read the document to him.

When using a journal to record your notarizations, it is a good idea to complete the journal entry prior to the notarization to ensure that the party does not leave before the necessary information is recorded.

Other important considerations:

- Journals can be used to refresh your memory about an event that occurred years earlier, and if kept consistently, may be relied upon for court testimony.
- Journals may also prove your compliance with the law.
- To be reliable, make sure that you record **_every_** notarial act and any special circumstances of the notarization.
- Do not share a journal with another notary.
- Guard your journal. Keep completed journals for at least 5 years.

Notary journals are usually available from your bonding agency, an office supply store, or one of the two national organizations that provide educational assistance to notaries. Even though journals are not required, any notary who is concerned with liability may want to consider this protective measure to provide a permanent record of his or her notarial acts.

## Order in the Court

A recent court decision should be of special interest to Florida notaries and their employers. In _Ameriseal of North East Florida, Inc. v. Leiffer_ (673 So. 2d 68 [Fla. 5th D.C.A. 1996]), the Court ruled that a notary public and the law firm that employs her may be held liable for damages resulting from an improper notarization.

A notary employed by a law firm agreed to notarize signatures on several documents as a favor to a coworker's husband. Neither of the document signers was present. Unknown to the notary, the husband was engaged in a fraudulent bond transaction involving the documents, and the individuals whose signatures were notarized did not actually have authority to sign the documents. A highway subcontractor lost a contract with the state Department of Transportation as a result of the fraudulent transaction.

The company sued the husband, the law firm, and the notary and won a default judgment for more than $350,000 against the husband. However, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the law firm and the notary, concluding that the improper notarization was not the proximate cause of the contractor's losses. The District Court of Appeal reversed, saying the contractor relied on documents without knowing that the notary (Ellis) had failed to verify the signers' identities.

The Court stated, "Ellis' obligation as a notary is quite simple: she must either know or have properly identified the affiants that appear before her and she must administer the proper oath. If business cannot depend on notaries doing this simple task, then there is no place for notaries in the world of commerce."

**Complaint Process**

Because notaries are appointed by the Governor, it is the responsibility of the Governor's Office to investigate allegations of misconduct by notaries. The Notary Section investigates hundreds of complaints each year and takes disciplinary action against those notaries found to have been negligent in their duties. Most complaints involve business deals gone awry, persons involved in legal disputes, or friends who asked the notary for a special favor.

The majority of the complaints, about 75 percent, are violations of the presence requirement, and most of those also involve allegations of forgery or fraud. Although the notaries are not usually involved in the forgery or fraud, they facilitate the commission of these crimes by not requiring the document signer to be present. Other common complaints are related to incomplete notarial certificates.

Once a complaint is received, a copy is forwarded to the notary requesting a sworn written response to the allegations. The notary's response is then sent to the complainant, giving him or her an opportunity to reply. The Notary Section may find it necessary to request additional information from either party or from other sources. Once all information is gathered, the complaint file is reviewed in its entirety by the Governor's legal staff.

If the allegations against the notary are unfounded, the complaint is dismissed. If the allegations prove to be true, the Governor's Notary Section recommends disciplinary action. The most common actions include a letter of advice in which the notary is advised of his or her improper action and the method for correcting the error; a written reprimand in which the notary is informed of the findings and issued a warning that any further violation or negligence of duties will result in stronger disciplinary action; and a request for the notary's resignation. When the notary resigns, the complaint is closed without any further action. However, in most cases, the notary will not be appointed again. If the complaint allegation involves a criminal violation, the complaint is referred to the appropriate State Attorney's Office for investigation.

A rarer, but stronger, form of disciplinary action is suspension from office by the Governor. Suspensions are typically done when a notary is convicted of a felony while commissioned, when the notary refuses to resign when requested by the Governor's Office, or when the notary cannot be contacted for a response. The process to accomplish a suspension requires the Governor to issue an executive order, filed with the Secretary of State, and the notary to appear before The Florida Senate for a hearing or trial. The Senate makes the final determination as to whether the notary should be permanently removed from office.

If you ever have a complaint filed against you, it is best for you to provide a timely and honest response to any request from the Governor's Office. Of course, the best way to avoid a complaint is to know and comply with the notary laws.

# REVIEW

## _Case Study ­ Presence Requirement and Notary Liability_

Marie Notary's friend Susan and Susan's father Roy came to Marie's office to get some papers notarized. Marie personally knew both Susan and Roy and notarized a number of documents for them.

Later that day, Susan returned with another document they had forgotten. The document was signed by Roy and needed to be notarized.

Susan explained that Roy could not leave work and asked Marie to notarize the signature even though Roy was not present. Marie did so.

Should Marie have notarized Roy's signature?

**NO !**

**_Now, for the rest of the story . . ._**

The document was a deed transferring ownership of Roy's home to Susan. Roy did not sign the document Susan forged his signature.

Using the deed as security, Susan obtained a loan for $27,900. Susan never made any payments, and the bank began foreclosure proceedings on the property.

Roy filed a lawsuit against the bank for relying upon a fraudulent deed. The bank filed a lawsuit against Marie for her illegal notarization.

The bank lost their claim to the property and Roy got his property back. But, the Court awarded the bank a judgment against Marie for $27,900. Additionally, Marie's bonding company paid out the entire amount of her bond ($1,000) to the bank, which she was required to repay.

By doing a favor for a friend, the notary was held liable for her improper notarization and had to pay back almost $30,000!

## Electronic Notarization

**What does electronic notarization mean to the traditional notary?**

Florida defines a notary public as a public officer appointed and commissioned by the Governor whose function is to administer oaths; to take acknowledgments of deeds and other instruments; to attest to or certify photocopies of certain documents; and to perform other duties as specified by law. Electronic notarization is simply a different platform in which to perform these legally sanctioned acts.  
  
With the Internet permitting execution of online documents that often require notaries public to verify the identity of the individual, the notarized digital signature legally executes an electronic document. Now legally recognized, the digital signature is equivalent to the traditional signature and seal of the notary - the pen is now a mouse and the stamp an electronic icon.  
  
Using the Internet as a medium means transactions can happen at light speed for individuals and businesses alike. Transactions that previously took days or weeks to process can now be accomplished in a matter of minutes. Additionally, utilizing e-transactions results in a reduction of transaction and processing expenses.  
  
Little additional training is needed to begin using electronic signatures, as electronic notarization is the online version of the offline, hard-copy process. As more electronic notarizations are performed, the opportunity for more economic transactions grows as well.  
  
Various pilot projects around the nation have proven the practicality and legality of using electronic means to conduct business. The Internet provides Floridians huge opportunities to capture e-commerce efficiencies. The service and experience notaries bring to the online process will enable this to occur.  
  
A noteworthy transaction took place in Florida early this summer with the first fully paperless mortgage loan and home purchase in the United States was completed. The entire procedure was originated, underwritten, processed, approved, and recorded electronically. The transaction was enabled by Florida's Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which specifically addresses the legality of electronic transactions, electronic records and electronic signatures. Importantly, electronic signatures were required at each phase of the process and these signatures still required a notary to perform the notarial act. However, instead of a traditional wet seal and signature, the acknowledgment was accomplished electronically.  
  
Same-day mortgages are only one example of how electronic signatures can benefit individuals. Other areas where electronic signatures can have a significant impact include business-to-business transactions, the financial and healthcare industries and governmental transactions (voting, accessing vital tax records, etc.). In some cases, the use of this technology will be mandatory to comply with state or federal regulation, such as the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  
  
The electronic medium is becoming the accepted norm in our society. The benefits are numerous. Notaries will be an integral part of the Information Age by utilizing technology that allows you to perform notarial acts electronically. Those using electronic notarization technology will be early adopters of the cutting-edge e-commerce revolution - with the associated prestige gained by those offering e-solutions.

**What is the need for electronic notarization?**

In recent months, numerous measures were approved that gave digital signatures the same legitimacy as ink signatures. This includes various pieces of state legislation (including the Florida Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (Title 39 Chapter 668.50) and federal legislation known as the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act), which was digitally signed by President Clinton on June 30, 2000 and took effect on October 1, 2000. What makes this bill so notable for notaries is Section 101(g), which recognizes the validity of electronic notarization.  
  
The passage of legislation removes many legal barriers to electronic commerce. Business continues to transcend time and space. Strangers do business with strangers locally and globally. The need to know that individuals are who they claim to be is critical in the business world. This legal setting provides a framework for the inclusion of electronic transactions. It is imperative that notaries be there to fill their role within this framework.  
  
The recent state and federal statutes concerning electronic transactions stemmed from governmental recognition of the significance of electronic commerce on the Internet. In 1999, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCSL) distributed what is known as the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). The basic objective of UETA is to ensure that e-transactions are as enforceable as traditional paper transactions. UETA specifically addresses "electronic records and electronic signatures relating to a transaction."  
  
UETA applies to transactions only when both parties have agreed to conduct the transaction electronically. It should be noted that while UETA recognizes the legality of electronic signatures, in no way does the Act require their use. UETA is technology-neutral - no one security measure or electronic signature policy is endorsed. Individuals can choose to implement the electronic signing method or security procedure of their choice. Those who opt to process documents or forms online can rest assured that electronic notarization is available and legally recognized under UETA. Notaries, or other individuals authorized to notarize documents who implement this technology, will be at the forefront of the e-commerce revolution.  
  
The NCCSL's national effort effectively provided guidelines to govern e-transactions. Many states have thus followed suit to implement their version of UETA. Florida's own version of UETA took effect July 1, 2000, as detailed in Florida Statutes Title 39, Chapter 668.50. This section applies to electronic records and electronic signatures relating to a transaction. However, this does not apply to transactions that are governed by the creation or execution of wills or testamentary trusts, the UCC other than Sections 671.107 and 671.206, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act or by rules relating to judicial procedure. Furthermore, it facilitates the use of electronic notarization by removing the rubber stamp and impression requirements for those notarizations that are performed electronically.  
  
UETA, as the NCCSL had hoped, is beginning to take root in various state legislation. Florida is part of the vanguard in promoting and recognizing online documentation. Other states have implemented, or are implementing, legislation as well. Notary involvement is vital to making the acceptance of electronic commerce a success! Taking advantage of today's technology and legislation allows notaries to empower themselves for tomorrow's world.

**How do e-notarization and e-signatures work?**

How can a notary digitally sign a document? Typically an electronic version of a document (e.g., a Word or Excel document) or online form is presented to a notary public. The notary administers an oath or takes the acknowledgement of the document signer, remembering that all current notary law, (Florida Statutes, Chapter 117), must be followed. The document is then signed by the owner of the document with a digital certificate or with a UCC signature (typing his/her name in a box). In turn, the notary also digitally signs the document in a similar fashion. The document is now electronically notarized and can be transmitted (e.g., via email) or saved to disk. The process is practically the same as that of paper notarization.  
  
The actual process of digitally notarizing an electronic document can be implemented by a number of various structures and approaches that allow us to realize the benefits of e-transactions and e-notarizations. The underlying technology in accomplishing secure transactions and authenticating individuals is encryption. Encryption is a process that transforms data to an unreadable format so that the information remains secure. This allows for a measure of authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality. In short, by using this technology, one can validate the integrity of the document and verify the identity of an individual - the key to notarizing online documents.  
  
Digital notarizations commonly use digital signatures, a type of electronic signature, in place of wet signatures. A digital signature, using the technology of a digital certificate, is a form of encrypted data that can be used to authenticate an individual and his or her document.  
  
The technology that allows for digital certificates and electronic signatures is precisely what makes electronic notarization legally acceptable. A digital signature is part of a system called Public-key Infrastructure (PKI) and has a corresponding component called a digital certificate. PKI is the generally accepted method of ensuring e-commerce security. Confidentiality, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation are four important ingredients required for trust in e-commerce transactions. The emerging response to meet these requirements is the implementation of PKI technology. In basic terms, PKI allows an individual to obtain a digital certificate, which then would be used to affix that individual's digital signature to an electronic document. A digital certificate holds vital information and allows for authentication of the individual, through the use of two related "keys," your private key and your public key, known as a key pair.  
  
Public key infrastructure incorporates various terms and technologies such as message digests (hash functions), asymmetric cryptography, tokens, X.509 certificates, public and private keys, nonrepudiation, and others. There is no doubt that the technologies used to digitally sign documents can be daunting. But for you, the notary, using this technology is completely transparent. Electronic notarization is achievable without requiring you to know the fundamental technology, allowing you to expand your notarial role without having to invest a lot of time in learning a new technology.  
  
A digital certificate is a credential (think of it as a driver's license online), issued by a trusted third party, known as a Certification Authority (CA) that validates individuals or organizations. A digital certificate is the foundation that allows a user to authenticate other users and to sign transactions with legally binding signatures.  
  
The (CA) stores or archives digital certificates and serves to validate a digital signature (and therefore a notarization's signatory). As stated, various firms act in this capacity including ARCANVS, Baltimore Technologies, Entrust Technologies, Thawte, and Verisign. Though methods and authentication procedures vary, all CAs provide a means to distribute digital certificates, maintain a repository of their issued certificates, and validate the identity of any certificate holder.  
  
That is all there is to it! The procedure remains essentially the same. You can view a digital signature as another form of the traditional pen - one you use to sign the document.

**How do I begin?**

To begin with, you can start by learning more about digital certificates and electronic security measures such as PKI. Contact any certification authority that specializes in witnessed-identity authentication. Additionally, there are several online sites that offer a wealth of information concerning security in an electronic arena.  
  
Second, conduct research on companies that offer digital certificates and become familiar with the electronic notarization environment. The need remains the same, but there are differences in how an electronic document is notarized. Knowing how the procedures work will ensure a smooth transition to electronic transactions, as well as make you an expert.  
  
Finally, relax! Technology does not necessarily mean adverse change. Recognizing the benefits that electronic notarization provides will help you allay any concerns. Your role will not diminish. On the contrary, incorporating electronic notarization into your functions will prepare you for the future - and add skills that make you more valuable to your employer and clients.
