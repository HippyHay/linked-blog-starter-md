**What is a Notary Public?**  
A notary public is a public officer appointed and commissioned by the Governor whose function is to administer oaths; to take acknowledgments of deeds and other instruments; to attest to or certify photocopies of certain documents; and to perform other duties specified by law.

**Qualifications and Requirements for Appointment**

You may only be commissioned in your legal name (or a nickname of your legal name). Example: John Quinton Public could be commissioned in the names:  

> John Quinton Public  
> John Q. Public  
> J. Quinton Public  
> J. Q. Public  
> Johnny Public

You must sign notarial certificates in your commissioned name, and your notary seal must bear that name. No variation from the commissioned name is permitted.

- You must be at least 18 years of age.
- You must be a legal resident of Florida. There is no certain length of time required to establish residency. However, if the Governor's Office requires proof of residency, the following methods, along with the applicant's intent to reside in Florida, would be acceptable: a Florida driver's license; a Florida vehicle registration document; a voter's registration card; or a recorded Declaration of Domicile.
- If not a U.S. citizen, you must submit a recorded Declaration of Domicile. This affidavit is available at your county clerk's office.
- If ever convicted of a felony charge, you must have your civil rights restored.

If ever convicted of a felony or if ever charged with a felony and adjudication was withheld on the charge or the sentence was suspended, you must submit several documents:

(1) a written statement regarding the nature and circumstances of the charges;

(2) a copy of the Judgment and Sentencing Order, or a comparable court document; and,

(3) if convicted, a copy of the Certificate of Restoration of Civil Rights (or pardon). The name of this document may vary depending on the state where the conviction occurred.

This information is required for all felony convictions whether the charges were brought by the State of Florida, another state, or the United States. If adjudication was withheld and civil rights were not forfeited, the written statement and court documents are sufficient.

To obtain information about the restoration of civil rights, you may contact:

> Office of Executive Clemency  
> 2601 Blair Stone Road  
> Building C, Room 229  
> Tallahassee, FL 32399-2450  
> (850) 488-2952 [](http://voice.google.com/calls?a=nc,%2B18504882952 "Call +1 850-488-2952 via Google Voice") 

**_Note:_** _Submission of all the required information does not guarantee appointment. Decisions are made on an individual basis._

- You must take the constitutional oath of office.
- You must swear or affirm that you have read the notary laws and will obey them.
- You must complete a three hour notary education course if you are a first time applicant. §668.50(b), Fla. Stat.

**Appointment and Commission**

- Notaries are public officers appointed and commissioned by the Governor. You are not licensed, you are appointed. An appointment is a privilege, not a right.  
    
- The term of office is four years. _Example:_ A commission which began on July 1, 1996 (12:01 a.m.) will end on June 30, 2000 (12:00 p.m.).  
    
- If your lawful name changes, you must request an amended commission by submitting the appropriate application form, a rider to the notary bond, and a fee of $25. You should contact your bonding company for assistance. Once you make application for a change of name, you may continue notarizing in your former name until receipt of your amended commission and seal. You will be given a new commission number, but you will retain the same expiration date.  
    
- If you lose your commission certificate, you may request a duplicate from the Department of State, Notary Commissions and Certifications section, or from your bonding agency.

### **Application Process**

- Since July 1, 1996, applications have been submitted by bonding agencies both in paper format and in an electronic format approved by the Department of State.  
    
- The application form is prescribed by the Department of State and consists of 3 parts:

> (1) _Personal information:_ name, social security number, date of birth, sex, race, residence address, place of employment, business address, home phone, business phone, Florida driver's license number or other state issued identification, information about any previous notary commission, residency status, citizenship status, criminal record, and information about any professional licenses.
> 
> (2) _Oath of office:_ The applicant must sign the following oath. The signature is the notary's legal signature on file.

|   |
|---|
|_State of Florida __________ County_<br><br>_I do solemnly (swear) (affirm) that I will support, protect and defend the Constitution and Government of the United States and of the State of Florida; that I am duly qualified to hold office under the Constitution of the State of Florida; that I have read Chapter 117, Florida Statutes, and any amendments thereto, and know the duties, responsibilities, limitations, and powers of a notary public, and that I will honestly, diligently, and faithfully discharge the duties of Notary Public, State of Florida, on which I am now about the enter (, so help me God)._<br><br>_Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have read the foregoing application and oath and that the facts stated in it are true._<br><br>_I accept the office of Notary Public, State of Florida._|

>   
> (3) _Affidavit of Character:_ A person who is unrelated to the applicant and who has known the applicant for at least one year must give a sworn statement that the applicant is of good character.
> 
> **_Note:_** _The application form no longer requires notarization._

- The total state fees are $39.  
    $25 application fee  
    $10 commission fee  
    $ 4 education surcharge

Veterans who served during a wartime period defined in law and who have a disability rating of 50% or more are exempt from the $10 commission fee. A veteran who qualifies should request the reduction in writing and provide proof of exemption. See section 117.01(2), Florida Statutes, (effective 1/1/97).

- Once the appointment is made, the commission certificate is usually mailed back to the bonding agency, who forwards it to the notary with the notary seal.

[**Back to top**](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/chapters/office.asp#top)

### **Renewal**

- The process to renew your notary commission is exactly the same as the application process to obtain your first appointment. The application form is the same and all the required information must be submitted. See sections 117.01(2) and (6), Florida Statutes.
- The State does not notify you prior to the expiration of your notary commission. However, you will probably receive notification from your bonding agency and a number of other companies seeking your business.
- Submit your application for renewal about two months in advance of your expiration date, or earlier if your application will require special review by the Governor's Office. That should be ample time for processing to ensure that there is no break in service.
- Continue using your current notary seal through the end of your current commission. If you are reappointed, you must not use your new notary seal until the first day of your new commission. Destroy your old seal to prevent its misuse.

### **Change of Address**

- You must submit any change in writing to the Notary Commissions and Certifications section.  
    
- You are required to keep your home and business addresses and telephone numbers updated.  
    
- If you move out of state and change your legal residence, you must resign your notary commission.  
    
- To change your address, you may photocopy and use the form on page 71 of the Governor's Reference Manual for Notaries.

### **Resignation**

- When resigning your commission, you must submit a resignation in writing to the Governor's Office, return your notary commission certificate (the original, not a copy), and destroy or return your notary seal.

### **Jurisdiction**

- You may only perform your official duties within the geographical boundaries of Florida.  
    
- Notaries are appointed with statewide jurisdiction; that is, you may perform your official duties anywhere within the state. You are not confined to the county in which you reside. You should always indicate in the notarial certificate the location of the notarization, usually designated by State of Florida, County of _____.  
    
- Notaries from other states have no authority to notarize while in the State of Florida.  
    
- If you are performing your duties on an airplane or a ship, check with the pilot or the ship's captain to make sure that you are within the state boundaries.

### **Surety Bond**

- Prior to appointment, applicants must obtain a surety bond in the amount of $7,500 and maintain that bond throughout the term of appointment.
- The bond does not protect the notary. The bond is designed to protect the public against any act of misconduct or negligence in the performance of your official duties as a notary public. It does not protect you. In fact, when a notary bond is paid to some individual who was harmed as a result of an improper notarization, the bonding company will usually demand repayment from the notary.
- For your protection, you may want to carry errors and omissions insurance. Contact your bonding company for information.

[**Back to top**](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/chapters/office.asp#top)

### **Notary Seal**

- The official notary seal is the rubber stamp type seal with four elements:  
    ­- the words, "Notary Public-State of Florida"  
    ­- the notary's exact commissioned name  
    ­- the notary's commission number  
    ­- the notary's commission expiration date  
    
- The name of the notary's bonding company may be included on the seal but is not required.  
    
- The state does not furnish notary seals. You may purchase a seal from your bonding company or from a company that makes rubber stamps.  
    
- Some companies that produce notary seals include a symbol or emblem on the stamp, such as the Capitol dome, a flag, an eagle, etc., but this is optional. No emblem or symbol is required. Additionally, you may NOT use the Great Seal of the State of Florida on your notary seal.  
    
- You may sign notarial certificates with any color ink, but the notary seal must be affixed with **_black_** ink only.  
    
- You may use an impression seal (embosser) in addition to the rubber stamp seal, but not in place of it. If you choose to use an impression seal, your name should be correct and the seal should contain the words, "Notary Public-State of Florida."  
    
- Before using your notary seal, examine the seal to ensure that all information is correct.  
    
- Keep your seal in a secure location to avoid its loss or misuse.  
    
- If your notary seal is lost, misplaced, or stolen, you are required to notify the Department of State (or the Governor's Notary Section) in writing. You should include your commission name and number, date of birth, and the last date the seal was in your possession. Additionally, if your seal was stolen, you should file a report with your local law enforcement agency. Please refer to Q & A section for instructions when an employer keeps your notary seal.

### **Notary Fees**

- Florida authorizes notaries to charge up to $10 for each notarial act administering an oath, taking an acknowledgment, attesting to a photocopy, verifying a VIN, or certifying the contents of a safe-deposit box.  
    
- Notaries may charge up to $20 to solemnize marriage (perform a marriage ceremony).  
    
- Fees are optional. Be reasonable when setting fees.  
    
- If you charge fees for other services not directly related to your notary services, you should provide your customer with an itemized list of charges beforehand.  
    
- If you are a government employee whose commission fees were paid by your employer for the purpose of notarizing during work hours, please review the information on Government Employees as Notaries.

Remember, notary fees are considered income and should be reported when filing annual income taxes.

## **Authentication of Notarized Documents by the Secretary of State**

On October 5, 1961, representatives from a group of nations met at The Hague in Holland to discuss various issues pertaining to international law. Out of that meeting came an international treaty known as the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents. More than 60 countries have joined the Convention, including the United States.

Documents that are notarized and sent to another country require verification or legalization of the notary's signature and official capacity prior to acceptance by the receiving country. The Hague Convention agreement simplifies the process by allowing the attachment of a single verifying certificate called an Apostille (a French word meaning "note"). The Apostille entitles the document to full recognition in the country of intended use, and no further authentication or legalization by the Embassy or Consulate of that country is required.

Each country, or subdivision of that country, has a designated official who is responsible for authenticating notarized documents. The treaty provides a list of officials in the United States with the authority to issue such certifications. In most states (47 out of 50), that authority is vested in the Secretary of State, or one or more of his or her deputies or assistants. Since the treaty came into force for the United States in October 1981, the Florida Secretary of State has been responsible for providing Apostilles for documents notarized in Florida and sent to another country. Revisions to the notary law, effective January 1, 1992, reaffirmed this authority. Section 117.103, Florida Statutes, provides:

> _Upon the receipt of a written request, the notarized document, and a fee of $10 payable to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State shall provide a certificate of notarial authority. Documents destined for countries participating in an International Treaty called the Hague Convention require an Apostille, and that requirement shall be determined by the Secretary of State._

Documents being sent to another state or a country not participating in the Hague Convention may also require certification. In that case, a Certificate of Notarial Authority is issued by the Secretary of State.

A notary public is not responsible for requesting an Apostille or a Certificate of Notarial Authority. Rather, according to the treaty, the person who signed the document or the document bearer may request authentication of documents. In order to provide that certification, the Department of State will need the following information:

- A written request for the Apostille or Certificate, stating the country or state to which the document will be sent. The Department of State will determine which authentication is appropriate for the receiving country.  
    
- The original notarized document. The notarization must fully comply with the requirements of Florida law, or the document will be returned for correction.  
    
- A check (drawn on an American bank) or a money order for $10 per certificate, made payable to the Secretary of State.

Mail the request, notarized document, and payment to:

**Department of State  
Division of Corporations  
P.O. Box 6327  
Tallahassee, FL 32314  
**

The Secretary of State will also provide an Apostille or Certificate for the following Florida documents: birth certificates and death certificates bearing the original signature of the State Registrar; vehicle titles certified by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles; corporation documents bearing the signature of the Secretary of State; and documents certified by any Clerk of the Court for any county in Florida (the fee for an Apostille on any county-certified document is $20).

Documents in proper order with correct notarizations sent to the Department of State are usually processed within 10 working days and are returned by regular mail to the sender or forwarded to an address given by the sender. For additional information, please contact the Department of State at (850) 245-6945.



## Duties

**Notaries are authorized by law to perform six basic duties:**

- Administer oaths or affirmations  
    
- Take acknowledgments  
    
- Attest to photocopies of certain documents  
    
- Solemnize marriage  
    
- Verify vehicle identification numbers (VINs)  
    
- Certify the contents of a safe-deposit box

Each of these duties is explained in detail in the following.

**Understanding Oaths and Acknowledgments**

The Governor's Notary Section answers hundreds of telephone inquiries every week regarding the notary law and proper notarial procedures. In talking with notaries, it is surprising how many of them do not understand the basic act of "notarizing a signature." Many incorrectly assume that they are just verifying identification and witnessing a signature. But, the act of notarization is much different.

When you notarize a signature, you must perform one of two official notarial acts: take an acknowledgment from or administer an oath (or affirmation) to the document signer. These two acts have different purposes. The lack of understanding of these basic duties causes confusion and often leads to errors in notarizations, even among the most experienced notaries.

To take an acknowledgment, the document signer must personally appear before you, the notary public, and declare that he or she has signed the document voluntarily. You should ensure that the signer understands the document and has not been coerced into signing. If there is any question about the signer's willingness to execute the document or his or her understanding of the contents of the document, you should refuse to notarize and perhaps refer the person to an attorney for legal advice. You may want to ask the signer, "Do you acknowledge that this is your signature and that you are executing this document of your own free will?" If the answer is yes, you should then complete a certificate which states that the execution of the document was acknowledged by the signer. Documents typically requiring an acknowledgment include deeds, mortgages, contracts, and powers of attorney (except those pertaining to motor vehicle titles).

An oath or affirmation is administered to a document signer when the signer is required to make a sworn statement about certain facts. The signer personally appears before you to swear (or affirm) to you, an officer duly appointed to administer oaths, that the information contained in the document is true. A person who makes a false oath or affirmation is subject to criminal charges for perjury. Sworn statements are commonly used in affidavits, depositions, and applications.

A notarization requiring an oath begins with the administration of an oath or affirmation. The courts have held that there should be a verbal exchange between the notary and the document signer in which the signer indicates that he or she is taking an oath. An oath similar to one administered in court by a judge or bailiff would be sufficient. Or, you may simply ask, "Do you swear (or affirm) that the information contained in this document is true?" After receiving an affirmative answer, you must complete a proper notarial certificate indicating that an oath or affirmation was taken.

If the document you are asked to notarize contains a prepared notarial certificate, look for the key words "acknowledged" or "sworn to" to tell you which notarial act is required. If there is no notarial certificate on the document, the signer must direct you whether he or she wants to make an acknowledgment or take an oath. Unless you are an attorney, you are not authorized to advise a person which notarial act is appropriate for the document presented for notarization, and you may not advise the person about the contents of the document.

In order to correctly perform the duties of your office, you need to understand what it means to "notarize a signature" and the difference between the acknowledgment and the oath.

> **_NOTE:_** _The form certificates used when taking an acknowledgment or administering an oath are found in the notary law, section 117.05(13), Florida Statutes._

**Affidavits**

An affidavit is a common form of sworn statement requiring an oath. Below is the standard form of  
affidavit. Please note that the affiant is the person making the sworn statement.

**AFFIDAVIT**

_**![](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/images/affidavit.gif)**_

**Depositions**

A deposition is the testimony of a witness, under oath or affirmation, taken outside of court in which lawyers ask oral questions of the witness. The testimony is usually reduced to writing and duly authenticated and is intended to be used in a trial of a civil action or a criminal prosecution. The person giving the testimony is called the deponent..

Notaries are authorized to administer an oath for a deposition for use in a court case or an investigation. When administering the oath, the notary must require the deponent's physical presence and properly identify him or her. If the notary keeps a journal or record of notarial acts, the journal entry should be made at this point, including the deponent's signature. The notary would then administer the oath or affirmation, perhaps by having the deponent raise his or her right hand and asking:

> _"Do you swear (or affirm) that the testimony you are about to give in this matter is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth (so help you, God)?"_

Once an affirmative answer is given, the deponent is now under oath, and the notary's responsibility is over.

Although depositions may be taken over the telephone, the deponent must be in the physical presence of the notary public, or other official authorized to administer oaths, at the time the oath or affirmation is given. There is no exception to the presence requirement, even if the attorneys for both parties stipulate otherwise. (See Attorney General Opinion, No. 92-95, December 23, 1992.) This means that, if you are asked to swear in a person over the phone, you must decline. A notary, or other authorized official, would have to be present with the deponent for the administration of the oath or affirmation.

When asked to make a written certificate of the notarial act, we suggest that you make a certificate in substantially the form provided below.

![](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/images/depositi.gif)

You should also know that, as a notary public, you are not authorized to take a deposition. That is, you may not actively participate in questioning a witness who is giving a deposition in a criminal or civil proceeding. A Florida appellate court recently ruled that the taking of a deposition constitutes the practice of law under section 454.23, Florida Statutes. Notaries who are not licensed attorneys are prohibited from engaging in the practice of law and may be suspended from office by the Governor for such violation.

The referenced case involved two paralegals, one of whom was a notary public, who owned a business that performed paralegal functions. Neither was a licensed attorney, but both readily admitted their active participation in several depositions. In its opinion, the Court explained:

> _A deposition is an important, formal, recorded proceeding in which lawyers must observe the Florida rules of court and must rely on their legal training and skills to question witnesses effectively. The activities and services involved in participating in a deposition often implicate ethical questions and strategic considerations of the utmost importance. The effectiveness of the person deposing a witness can have a significant impact on whether objectionable information is identified and addressed or waived, whether a case is made, and how the evidence therefrom is used in any subsequent legal proceeding . . . Without a doubt, the process of directly examining or cross-examining a witness can affect important rights under the law . . . We conclude that, lacking adequate legal training, a nonattorney participating in the examination of a witness poses the very dangers of incompetent, unethical, or irresponsible representation . . . we hold that the nonlawyer appellees' active participation in questioning witnesses in depositions . . . constitutes the unauthorized practice of law in violation of section 454.23, Florida Statutes._

The notary involved has been denied a renewal appointment by the Governor's Office and both persons have pending criminal charges for the unlicensed practice law. Be careful that you do not overstep your authority when asked to swear in a person for a deposition. The unauthorized practice of law is a serious matter and one that is not taken lightly by the Governor's Office or the Court.

**_Note:_** _For additional information on the court case, see State v. Foster, 674 So.2d 747 (Fla. 1st DCA 1996)._

[**Back to top**](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/chapters/duties.asp#top)

**Attesting to Photocopies**

In Florida, notaries are authorized to attest to the trueness of photocopies of certain documents. Although commonly known as certified photocopies, the notary law refers to these documents as attested photocopies. A notary public may make attested photocopies if the following criteria, found in section 117.05(12) of the Florida Statutes, are satisfied.

- The document must be an original document. A notary public cannot make an attested photocopy from a photocopy, or from another certified copy.
- The document cannot be a public record, certified copies of which are available from another public official. If a certified copy can be obtained from the official source, then the notary public should decline the request.
- The making of the photocopy must be supervised by the notary public. It is not sufficient for the notary public to compare the photocopy with the original document. The notary public must actually make the photocopy or supervise another person while he or she makes the photocopy.

After making (or supervising the making of) the photocopy, the notary should complete a notarial certificate in substantially the same form as prescribed by law.

![](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/images/photocpy.gif)

This notarial certificate should be typed, stamped or written on the front or back of the photocopy or may be attached as a separate page.

One of the most often asked questions concerning attested photocopies is whether a particular document is a public record. Notaries must make a determination about this question before attesting to the trueness of any photocopy. The following documents are examples of public records, copies of which cannot be attested to by a notary:

- Birth certificate
- Marriage certificate
- Death certificate
- Certificate of citizenship or naturalization
- Documents filed in a court proceeding
- Documents recorded by the Clerk of the Court
- Public records maintained in government offices
- Student records (transcripts, etc.) kept in public education offices
- Federal or state income tax forms, already filed
- Professional licenses issued by the State of Florida
- Any document for which photocopying is prohibited

This is not a complete list of public records. If the document is issued by a government entity, the notary should contact that entity to determine whether a certified copy is available. If one is available, then the notary public must decline to make an attested photocopy. Additionally, the notary should ask the person if the document has been filed in a court proceeding or in the official records at the courthouse.

The following documents can be photocopied from the original (if not officially filed or recorded) and attested to by a notary, because certified copies cannot be obtained from another public official:

- Florida driver's license
- Florida vehicle title
- Social Security card
- Diploma
- Medical record
- U.S. passport
- Bill of sale
- Contract
- Lease
- Resident alien card
- Personal letter

The maximum fee a notary may charge for making an attested photocopy is $10.

**Solemnizing Marriage**

Florida is one of only three states which authorize notaries public to perform marriage ceremonies. The following guidelines should be helpful.

**Procedure**

- The couple must obtain a valid Florida marriage license from a county court judge or clerk of the circuit court and present it to the notary public before the marriage ceremony.  
    
- The notary public performs the marriage ceremony. An example of a simple, civil ceremony is printed below. It may be personalized, and the bride and groom may even exchange their own vows. But, the couple's vows must reflect their intentions to make a legally binding commitment to each other.  
    
- The notary public is responsible for making a certificate on the appropriate portion of the marriage license and returning it to the office of the county court judge or clerk of the circuit court which issued the license within 10 days after solemnizing the marriage. § 741.08, Fla. Stat.

**General Information**

- A Florida notary public may perform a marriage ceremony only within the geographical boundaries of this state.  
    
- A notary public may charge up to $20 for solemnizing the rites of matrimony. §§ 117.045 & 28.24 (29), Fla. Stat.  
    
- A notary public may perform a marriage ceremony for a person who is related to him or her by blood or marriage. The prohibition against notarizing the signature of a spouse, son, daughter, mother, or father does not apply because the notary is not notarizing the signature of the bride and groom, but is only certifying that the couple have been joined in marriage by the notary according to the laws of the State of Florida. Op. Att'y Gen. Fla. 91-70 (1991).  
    
- The notary should check the expiration date of the license to ensure that the license is still valid. The notary should also require identification if the bride and groom are not personally known.  
    
- It is recommended that two witnesses, other than the notary, sign the marriage certificate in the event that proof of the marriage ceremony is necessary in the future.

Additional information about solemnizing marriage is located in the Q&A section.

**Verifying a VIN**

Florida law requires that, when applying for a Florida title for the first time on a used motor vehicle, the owner must sign a sworn statement that the vehicle identification number (VIN) and the odometer reading on the vehicle are correct.

Additionally, a physical inspection of the vehicle must be done by an authorized person to certify the VIN. Notaries public are included in the list of persons authorized to certify this information. § 319.23(3)(a)(2), Fla. Stat.  

A form prepared by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, HSMV 82042 (Rev. 5/95)S, is used for this purpose.

![](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/IMAGES/DHMV.GIF)

Part A requires the owner's sworn statement regarding the correct VIN and odometer reading. A jurat, or notarial certificate, is provided in this section. The notary should make sure that the information in Part A is complete prior to the notarization.

Part B requires the notary public, or other authorized person, to certify that he or she has physically inspected the vehicle and found the VIN to be identical to the number recorded on the form. The notary public must include the date, sign the document, print his or her name, and affix his or her notary seal.

This VIN verification form is also found on the Application for Certificate of Title With/Without Registration, HSMV 82040 (Rev. 5/96)S. These forms and all other forms related to vehicle registration are available from the tag office of the Tax Collector's Office in each county.

**Certifying the Contents of a  
Safe-Deposit Box**

Florida law provides that a financial institution may open a safe-deposit box if the rental fee is past due, providing that proper notice has been made and that certain other conditions are met. A notary public is authorized and required to be present for the opening of the safe-deposit box, to inventory the contents of the vault, and to make an appropriate certificate of the opening. The notary is not required to estimate the value of the contents of the safe-deposit box.

As with other notarial acts, the maximum fee a notary may charge for performing the authorized duties at the opening of a safe-deposit box is $10.  
  
The law authorizing notaries to perform this function became effective on July 3, 1992, and is found in section 655.94(1), Florida Statutes.

**Procedure for the Notary Public**

- The notary must be present at the time the safe-deposit box is opened and may not be a director, officer, employee, or stockholder of the financial institution. An officer of the institution must also be present with the notary at the opening of the safe-deposit box.  
    
- When the safe-deposit box is opened, the notary should inventory the contents of the box and should complete a certificate reciting the name of the lessee, the date of the opening, and a list of the contents. Florida law does not provide a form certificate; however, the following form, prepared by the Notary Section, should be sufficient.

- Once the certificate is completed, copies should be made. The notary should place the original certificate in a package with the contents of the safe-deposit box and seal the package. The notary must then write on the outside of the package the name of the lessee and the date of the opening.  
    
- The notary should leave the sealed package and a copy of the certificate with the financial institution.  
    
- If the notary keeps a record book or journal of notarial acts, details of the act should be recorded. It may be a good idea to require the person opening the box, the officer of the institution, and any other witness to sign the journal as well.

The State Constitution authorizes the Governor to suspend a notary public from office for "malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty, drunkenness, incompetence, permanent inability to perform his official duties, or commission of a felony." s.7, Art. IV, Fla. Const.

> **_Subsection 117.01(4) of the Florida Statutes provides:_**

The Governor may suspend a notary public for any of the grounds provided in s. 7, Art. IV of the State Constitution. Grounds constituting malfeasance, misfeasance, or neglect of duty include, but are not limited to, the following:

> (b) A complaint found to have merit by the Governor.
> 
> (c) Failure to cooperate or respond to an investigation by the Governor's Office or the Department of State regarding a complaint.

> 
> (j) Failure to maintain the bond required.

**Civil Penalty**

_Section 117.107(9) of the Florida Statutes provides in part:_

A notary public may not notarize a signature on a document if the person whose signature is being notarized is not in the presence of the notary public at the time the signature is notarized. Any notary public who violates this paragraph is guilty of a civil infraction, punishable by penalty not exceeding $5,000, and that conduct constitutes malfeasance and misfeasance in the conduct of official duties. It is no defense to the civil infraction specified in this paragraph that the notary public acted without intent to defraud. A notary public who violates this paragraph with the intent to defraud is guilty of violating s.117.105.

**Criminal Penalties**

- No person shall obtain or use a notary public commission in other than his legal name, and it is unlawful for a notary public to notarize his own signature. Any person applying for a notary public commission must submit proof of his identity to the Department of State if so requested. Any person who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 s 775.083, or s. 775.084. § 117.05(1).  
    
- Any person who acts as or otherwise willfully impersonates a notary public while not lawfully appointed and commissioned to perform notarial acts is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. § 117.05(7).

### **Don't Notarize Photographs**

Occasionally, you may be asked to "notarize" a photograph. Please be aware that certifying or notarizing photographs is not an authorized notarial act under Florida law.

You may, however, notarize a person's signature on a written statement concerning the photograph. For example, if John Doe wants to certify that the person in a particular photograph is John Doe, he could sign a sworn written statement stating that the photograph is of John Doe. You could then notarize his signature on that statement in the same way that you notarize any sworn written statement. His statement could be made on the back of the photograph or on a separate paper to be attached to the photograph.

Keep in mind that you should not certify or attest that the person in the photograph is John Doe. Rather, you should certify that the statement concerning the photograph was signed and sworn to in your presence by John Doe. This is accomplished by using the standard notarial certificate (jurat) provided in the Florida Statutes for oaths. Remember, you should never apply your notary seal to and sign any document without completing a proper notarial certificate.

## **Don't Provide Certified Copies of  
Birth Certificates**

The Notary Section continues to receive numerous inquiries about certifying copies of birth certificates. A notary public may NOT make a certified photocopy of a birth certificate, whether it was issued in Florida, another state, or a foreign country. Birth certificates are official records and certified copies may be obtained from the public official who is the custodian of the records.

The typical problem arises when a person is leaving the country within a few days and is required by his or her travel agency to have a "notarized" birth certificate. The word "notarized" immediately sends the person to a notary public. Actually, a person should obtain a "certified" copy of his or her birth certificate, rather than a "notarized" copy. Notaries should decline to certify or notarize these documents for two reasons.

First, a notary public may not attest to the trueness of a photocopy of a public record if a copy can be made by another public official. The Florida Department of Health retains vital records such as birth certificates, death certificates, marriage licenses, and certain divorce records. The Department produces certified copies of these documents when requested by an authorized person.

Second, a notary public may only attest to the trueness of a photocopy of an original document. Most people do not possess their original birth certificate; they only have a certified copy.

Additionally, Florida law prohibits even the photocopying of birth certificates. This would eliminate the alternative procedure of attaching an affidavit to a photocopy of a birth certificate in which a party swears that the photocopy is a true copy of the birth certificate.

Officials at the Bureau of Vital Statistics in Jacksonville, where Florida vital records are housed, report that birth certificates and other vital records are available from their office and may be available for the last 30 years from the county health department in most counties in Florida. The Jacksonville office takes orders by telephone using a major credit card for payment and even offers express or overnight delivery for an additional fee. It is best, of course, to request such records in writing allowing 2-3 weeks for delivery.  
  
If you are requested to make a certified copy of a birth certificate, or other vital record, please decline and refer the party to the public office holding that record. If the document is a Florida vital record, the party may go to the county health department or write to:

**Department of Health  
Bureau of Vital Statistics  
Vital Records Section  
1217 Pearl Street  
Jacksonville, Florida 32202**

For telephone orders or additional information, the party may call the Jacksonville office at (904) 359-6931 [](http://voice.google.com/calls?a=nc,%2B19043596931 "Call +1 904-359-6931 via Google Voice")or (904) 359-6912[](http://voice.google.com/calls?a=nc,%2B19043596912 "Call +1 904-359-6912 via Google Voice").

## **Don't Notarize Blank Documents**

Apparently, it is a common practice for people to sign a blank power of attorney form to facilitate the sale of a motor vehicle. Notaries should be careful not to notarize incomplete documents.

Many notarized blank forms have been found at car dealerships by DMV investigators and are often presented to officials at U.S. Customs in Miami. According to officials at these agencies, incomplete forms will not be accepted, and if notarized, they will be presented to the State Attorney's Office and to the Governor's Office for investigation and appropriate action.
