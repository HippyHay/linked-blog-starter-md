specialty worth noting within the field of property management is a **community association manager (CAM). The difference between a property manager** and a community association manager is that a community association manager must hold a CAM license, while a property manager does not need a CAM license. CAMs manage community associations such as:
- Mobile home parks
- Planned unit developments (PUDs)
- Homeowners associations
- Cooperatives
- Timeshares
- Condominiums
We'll be learning more about these types of properties throughout this course.

If a license holder is managing one of these types of properties, and if that property has eleven or more units or an annual budget over $100,000, they need a CAM license.

A CAM license is NOT required to manage a rental apartment building (the eleven units rule doesn't apply here), commercial property, or single-family unit like a residential rental home.

**Responsibilities**:
Landlords- requiring tenants and maintaining positive relationships, collect rent and keep record using a rent roll

**Marketing your property**:
- A market analysis
- A budget
- An outline of their marketing tactics (i.e., a budget for how much money will be spent on each marketing strategy)

**Market Analysis**
- The property itself
- The property's region
- The property's neighborhood

**Property specialization** 
- Industrial property
- Special-purpose property
- Residential property
- Commercial property

**Sign a property Management agreement** 
Management fee must be listed here 
Comes in two forms:
- A **percentage fee** is a fee paid to the manager based on the effective gross income (EGI) of the building. This includes income from rent plus additional revenue streams.
- A **flat fee,** or base commission, is a fixed fee paid per unit, not based on a percentage of the income.
Rental agents: find tenants and paid based off that 
In Florida, if a property manager does not receive a commission they are not required to have a real estate license.
