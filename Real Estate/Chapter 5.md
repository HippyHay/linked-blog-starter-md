Use evaluation products to find the value of the property, appraisals are the best and BPAs are the lowest. 
Define what an appraisal is and explain the purpose of appraisals in real estate transactions
- Identify who can perform appraisals
- Describe a comparative market analysis (CMA)
- Understand the purpose of a CMA and broker’s opinion of value (BOV)
An appraisal is an official valuation of a property’s value. A few characteristics of an appraisal are that it:
- Is an impartial, qualified appraiser's opinion of value
- Applies to a specific property as of a specific date
- Is supported by relevant market information
An appraisal is a very educated and data-driven approach to finding the market value of a property

An **appraiser** is an individual who is trained and licensed to perform appraisals, or officially estimate the value of real property.
**Appraiser Skills:**
- Strong analytical skills
- The ability to observe and assess market trends
- The ability to separate opinion from fact
**Appraiser requirements:**
1. You must meet the education requirements for the type of appraisal license for which you're applying.
2. You must gain the experience required for your desired license or certification.
3. You must pass the written exam.

In Florida appraisers aren't the only ones who can file a appraisal 
- In Florida, a state-licensed and certified appraiser is the only one who can do an appraisal for federally-related transactions
- A real estate licensee may perform an appraisal and receive compensation for doing so in all other, non-federal transactions.

**Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP)** is an agency charged with overseeing, regulating, and promulgating real estate appraisals and appraisal practices.

**It is unethical for an appraiser to accept compensation based on the value of a property**

What can be Appraised: 
- Single-family homes
- Apartment buildings
- Condominiums
- Offices
- Shopping centers
- Farms
- Commercial buildings

Situations involving appraisal :
- Any sale of real estate
- Mortgage lending, especially for government-backed loans
- Setting rental rates for leased property
- Finding investment values
- Government acquisitions of property, such as eminent domain
- Acquiring property insurance
- Tax assessment appeals

 The lender chooses an appraiser, not a report

# Comparative Market Analysis

**Comparative market analysis (CMA)** is a report that compares the prices of recently sold or listed homes ("comparables") in order to estimate the market value of a similar property (the "subject property") located in the same area.

CMAs, though similar in some ways to an appraisal, are NOT appraisals and may NOT be represented as an appraisal.

## CMA vs. Appraisal
not the same

Here are a few significant **differences** between the two:
- You sometimes have to have an appraiser's license to create an appraisal.
- An appraisal is usually done for a fee.
- A CMA is usually done for free.
- A CMA is less detailed AND less reliable than an appraisal

In spite of those differences, a CMA and an appraisal have a few **commonalities**:
- Both are used to arrive at a fair market value of a property.
- Both use a sales comparison approach that is based on the principle of substitution and the principle of contribution.

With compliance, one important difference worth calling out is that appraisals must conform to USPAP standards but CMAs do not.
