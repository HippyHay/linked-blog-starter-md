Impacts what can be built where, under what conditions, and how much of each construction is allowed. Division of land within a jurisdiction into different districts that uses are permitted, prohibited, and regulates the use of land. Create 
**Zoning ordinances** - local laws that control how land is used and what structures can be built
Developers have to be aware of zoning laws, enforced by local government
