- Describe relevant Florida real estate license laws 
who can get a license, what requires a license, what the punishment is for not having a license 

Real estate laws are present to protect the buyer
## Statutory Law
Real estate license law, chapter 475 is born in 1923
#### **FREC**
1925, FREC is introduced, which **FREC is a quasi-judicial body that administers and enforces license law in Florida.**
#### **The DBPR:** 
Gives FREC its administrative support, standing for The Division of Real Estate
In charge of licenses for all kinds of professions in the state, administrative work.
The DBPR handle most of the administrative work, like recording registrations and keeping track of licensees, while the FREC makes rules and hears disciplinary actions.

## Florida Statute Chapter 475
A collection of statutes that deal with real estate. Citations are where to look in the law to find the relavent legal text.

Example: 
**475.001, F.S.** = What that is telling you is that you can find the relevant law in the Florida statutes (F.S.), chapter 475, subchapter 001.

Broken up into 4 parts
1. **Real estate brokers, sales associates, and schools:** This is where most of the stuff we're interested in lives. It regulates brokers, sales associates, and schools.
2. **Appraisers:** This section sets out rules for appraisers, including licensing requirements. Appraisers are overseen by the Florida Real Estate Appraisal Board (FREAB), which is essentially the appraiser version of the FREC.
3. **The Commercial Real Estate Sales Commission Lien Act:** This gives commercial brokers the right to put a lien on a property they've sold to collect their commission (more on what this means later).
4. **The Commercial Real Estate Leasing Commission Lien Act:** Same thing but for commercial rental properties.
Examples of what you'll find:
- The requirements for a real estate school
- The requirements for sales associates and brokers
- Definitions of sales associate and broker
- Information about the real estate recovery fund
- Rules about license renewal, fees, and continuing education
- What constitutes an active or inactive license
#### Chapter 475 Is Your Go-to Law for Real Estate

## 61J2 of the Florida Administrative Code
Set of rules created by the FREC to enforce Chapter 475
FREC enforces the law
**61J2 is the *how* to Chapter 475s *what*** 
Florida Administration code contains all types of professions and scenarios, not just real estate, thats why it has that name. 

Example: 
**61J2-3.015, F.A.C. F.A.C.** stands for Florida Administrative Code, 61J2 tells you to look in part 61, J2 (where the real estate rules live), and 3.015 tells you to look in chapter three (Minimum Educational Requirements), part 015 (Notice of Satisfactory Course Completion).

## Chapter 20, Florida Statutes
All others that aren't Chapter 475 or 61JR
**Chapter 20 established the organizational structure of the executive branch.**

**DPBR:**
The Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) lives in the executive branch. 
**The DBPR is the entity that actually records and issues licenses.**

**Example:**
**20.001, F.S.**, or even just Chapter 20, F.S.

## Chapter 455, Florida Statutes
Sets out general rules covering all processions regulated by the DBPR
Chapter 455 codifies the general practices and procedures used by the DBPR.
#### 455.10, F.S.
One very important part of Chapter 455 is subchapter 10, which says that **one does not need to be a U.S. citizen to get a professional license in Florida.** But you do need a SSN

Example:
First the chapter (455), then the subchapter (.10), then the reference to the law (F.S., for Florida statutes)

## Chapter 120, Florida Statutes
Chapter 120 is entitled **the Administrative Procedure Act** and it has to do with how regulatory agencies decide and implement agency action.

Chapter 120 lays out how all regulatory agencies (for example, the FREC) carry out their licensing procedures and disciplinary processes.

**Chapter 455** outlines the rules, _in general_, for professions regulated by the DPBR. It explains what the DBPR is in charge of what FREC is in charge of. It makes a general set of rules for all professions.

**Chapter 120** has the rules for what the FREC and other regulatory bodies have to do in terms of licensing and licensee discipline. It covers things like how long the FREC can take to accept or reject an application. It DOESN'T cover the specific rules for who can apply for which kind of license. That's in Chapter 475. Think of it like Chapter 120 makes the rules for the FREC, and Chapter 475 makes the rules for licensees.

**Chapter 475** has all of the laws specific to the practice of real estate. This law outlines who can apply for a license, what the licensing exam looks like, and how to maintain a license. Makes sense? Good!
