A collection of statutes that deal with real estate. Citations are where to look in the law to find the relavent legal text.

Example:

Broken up into 4 parts
1. **Real estate brokers, sales associates, and schools:** This is where most of the stuff we're interested in lives. It regulates brokers, sales associates, and schools.
2. **Appraisers:** This section sets out rules for appraisers, including licensing requirements. Appraisers are overseen by the Florida Real Estate Appraisal Board (FREAB), which is essentially the appraiser version of the FREC.
3. **The Commercial Real Estate Sales Commission Lien Act:** This gives commercial brokers the right to put a lien on a property they've sold to collect their commission (more on what this means later).
4. **The Commercial Real Estate Leasing Commission Lien Act:** Same thing but for commercial rental properties.
Examples of what you'll find:
- The requirements for a real estate school
