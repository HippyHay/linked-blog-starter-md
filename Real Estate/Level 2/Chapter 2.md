## Types of Real estate Licenses 
There are three main **types of real estate licensees in Florida: 
- Broker
- Sales associate
- Broker associate (475.01, F.S.).**
### Broker 
A person or business entity who is licensed to represent one of the parties in a real estate transaction in exchange for a commission or other valuable consideration. A broker supervises sales associates and broker associates.
### Sales Associate
A **sales associate** is a real estate license holder who is associated with a licensed broker for the purpose of performing real estate brokerage acts on the broker’s behalf.
(A salesperson can't accept compensation directly from a principal; it must come from their own broker.)

A sales associate must be supervised by either a broker or an owner-developer, which is an unlicensed entity that sells, exchanges or leases its own property. Salaried staff members of an owner-developer can work without a license: A sales associate license is only necessary if the employee is paid commission.
### Broker Associate
an individual who meets the licensure requirements to be a real estate broker but provides real estate brokerage services as an independent contractor to a real estate broker.
A **broker associate** is a person who has passed the broker exam, but chooses to work under a sponsoring broker.

# Who needs a license?
A license is a must-have for anyone who wants to provide **real estate services**.
## Real Estate Services (475.01, F.S.)
If you're doing any of these, you're performing a real estate service:
- Appraise, auction, sell, buy, rent, exchange, or lease real property, including mineral rights
- Appraise, auction, sell, buy, rent, exchange, or lease business enterprises or opportunities
- Advertise that you will do either of the above
- Negotiate or close a real estate transaction or the sale of a business
## Businesses Are Real Estate in Florida

**A**uctioning
**C**losing on property or businesses
**E**xchanging property or businesses
## Compensation
valuable consideration directly or indirectly paid or promised, expressly or impliedly, or with an intent to collect or receive a compensation or valuable consideration therefor.
## No Freebies
If someone is giving you something to perform real estate services for them, you're being compensated, and you need a license.
## No Sharing
License holders cannot share their commission with an unlicensed person, including by giving them a referral fee.
## Presumption of Doing Real Estate (475.43, F.S.)
If you advise someone on their real estate dealings, you or your broker could be held liable.
## Exempt from licensing  (475.011 F.S.)
### 1. Property Owners 
- The owner of a property, whether that's a person or a firm, can manage or perform other real estate activities for their own property (or properties) without a license.
- Also includes officers of corporation buying and selling as long as they don't commission for it
- Non-licensed property owners selling their own property can only receive as much of the profit as the amount they own, proportionally. So if you own 60% of a property, and you sell it yourself, you can only get a maximum of 60% of the profit. Otherwise, you're technically being compensated for performing real estate services for others.

### 2. Court-Appointed Individuals
- unlicensed individuals acting as an officer f the court can engage in some real estate activities as long as it's in the context of their authority 
	- examples: receiver, trustee, administrator, executor

### 3. CPAs
- A Certified Public Accountant can practice real estate as long as it's within the bounds of their normal duties.
### 4. Salaried Property or Leasing Managers
- A person who works in the leasing office of a building, or who acts as an employee manager of a condo or co-op building can find tenants and sign leases, as long as the leases are for no more than a year. Additionally, they MUST BE SALARIED. If they receive commission from finding tenants, they must be licensed.
- Also, property managers of community associations with more than 10 units or with a budget of more than $100,000 a year are required to get a community association manager (CAM) license from the DBPR. This is not a real estate license, but a completely separate kind of licensure.
### 5. Attorneys in Fact
- An attorney in fact is someone a person has designated to perform legal activities for them. So someone's designated attorney in fact can sign deeds or contracts on their behalf, for no compensation.
### 6. Employees of Public Utilities
- An employee of a public utility, a rural electric cooperative, a railroad, or a state or local governmental agency can rent, buy, sell, appraise, exchange, auction, or lease property as part of their normal duties for their employer, so long as they aren't paid for their work beyond their salaries.
### 7. Just Regular Attorneys
- Attorneys can practice real estate within the scope of their duties, but cannot be paid for it without a license.
### 8. College or Grad Student Studying Appraisal
- Students studying appraisal can do appraisals as long as they are under the supervision of a broker or licensed appraiser.
### 9. Radio, Television, or Cable Enterprises Licensed and Regulated by the Federal Communications Commission
- Remember how in Florida, you need a real estate license to sell a business? Well, one exception to this is a salaried employee selling radio, television, or cable enterprises licensed and regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, pursuant to Communications Act of 1934. That's for the business only — if it involves land or buildings, you still need a license.
### 10. People Registered With the SEC to Sell Businesses
- Because of a federal law, people registered with the SEC to sell certain businesses to accredited investors can do so without a license.
### 11. Tenant Referral Fees Under $50
- Buildings can give unlicensed tenants up to $50 in referral fees for finding new tenants.
### 12. Hotel and Motel Clerks
- Hotel and motel clerks don't need a license to sell transient occupancy or public lodging.
### 13. Cemetery Lots
- **Cemetery lots aren't considered real property in Florida, so you don't need to be licensed to sell them.**
### 14. Manufactured Home or RV Lot Rentals
- You don't need a license to rent manufactured home (mobile home) lots or RV lots, because in Florida they are also not considered real property.
### 15. Exchange Companies
- Timeshare exchange company employees do not need to be licensed.
### Conclusion 
- A few of them are designed to relieve the licensing burden from people who encounter real estate-related tasks in the course of their normal job duties or court-ordered duties. Another key takeaway is that property owners or employees of an owner can engage in property management without a real estate license.
