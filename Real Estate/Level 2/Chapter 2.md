## Types of Real estate Licenses 
There are three main **types of real estate licensees in Florida: 
- Broker
- Sales associate
- Broker associate (475.01, F.S.).**
### Broker 
A person or business entity who is licensed to represent one of the parties in a real estate transaction in exchange for a commission or other valuable consideration. A broker supervises sales associates and broker associates.
### Sales Associate
A **sales associate** is a real estate license holder who is associated with a licensed broker for the purpose of performing real estate brokerage acts on the broker’s behalf.
(A salesperson can't accept compensation directly from a principal; it must come from their own broker.)

A sales associate must be supervised by either a broker or an owner-developer, which is an unlicensed entity that sells, exchanges or leases its own property. Salaried staff members of an owner-developer can work without a license: A sales associate license is only necessary if the employee is paid commission.
### Broker Associate
an individual who meets the licensure requirements to be a real estate broker but provides real estate brokerage services as an independent contractor to a real estate broker.
A **broker associate** is a person who has passed the broker exam, but chooses to work under a sponsoring broker.

### Property Owners 
- The owner of a property, whether that's a person or a firm, can manage or perform other real estate activities for their own property (or properties) without a license.
- Also includes officers of corporation buying and selling as long as they dont commission for it
- Non-licensed property owners selling their own property can only receive as much of the profit as the amount they own, proportionally. So if you own 60% of a property, and you sell it yourself, you can only get a maximum of 60% of the profit. Otherwise, you're technically being compensated for performing real estate services for others.

### Court-Appointed Individuals
- unlicensed individuals acting as an officer f the court can engage in some real estate activities as long as it's in the context of their authority
