**Law of Agency:** the body of laws, often unwritten, affecting agency that have come about as a result of custom and/or case law.

**Common law** can be traced back to **customs and precedent established by court decisions** over the centuries in England

**Statutory laws** are those laws that are **introduced at the state or federal level**.
In Florida, the laws enacted by state legislature that pertain to real estate licensure, and the use of agency within real estate, are found in Title XXXII, Chapters 455 and 475.
