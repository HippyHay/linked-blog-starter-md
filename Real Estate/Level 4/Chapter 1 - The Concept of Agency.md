# Agency Relationships in Real Estate

In other words, an agency relationship is **a relationship wherein one party authorizes another to represent their interests and that second party accepts the responsibility given to them.**

Different duties require different types of authorized brokerage relationships. 
### Mutual Consent Required
- Written agreement ✏️
- Oral agreement 🗣
To prevent miscommunication (and protect their commissions), licensees should always form their agency relationships **in writing.** And in Florida, as with many states, it's a statutory requirement that certain agency relationships be disclosed in express written form.
### Relationship Components
1. Two parties (agent and client/customer)
2. An agreement
3. A duty
#### Scenario: Krista Gets a Broker
Buyer Krista entered into a single agency relationship with Broker Jaselle when Krista signed a buyer-broker agreement with Jaselle. The agreement gave Jaselle authority to represent Krista's best interests in her effort to buy a house.
so...
1. Two parties = Krista (principal) and Jaselle (agent operating as a fiduciary)
2. An agreement = the buyer-broker agreement
3. A duty = Jaselle's obligation to help Krista buy a house
