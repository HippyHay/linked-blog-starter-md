## Three Agency Classifications
- Special agency
- General agency    
- Universal agency
## Special Agency
**Special agency**, a.k.a. _limited agency_, restricts an agent's scope of authority to one or more specific acts as directed by the party — usually towards a single, specific objective, end, or goal.
Not ongoing
Most limited in scope
#### Example
Due to a scheduling conflict, Betty couldn't make it to the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce charity auction. So she authorized Buddy to attend the auction and bid on an exquisite vase she's had her eye on ever since the auction program was posted on the town's website two weeks earlier. Betty instructed Buddy to bid on that one item only. She gave him a top-bid limit of $750.
Buddy's special agency was restricted in scope in two respects:
1. He could only bid on the specific vase Betty wanted.
2. He could bid no more than $750 for the vase.
#### Special Agency in Real Estate
**The relationship between real estate brokers and the parties they represent will almost always be a special agency relationship,** with the single, specific goal being the sale or purchase of a property.![A special agency flow chart showing a broker is authorized to preform specific actions for the party represented.](https://d1u7daj727sadp.cloudfront.net/images/FL_SpecialAgencyRelationship_4425.png)
#### Actions
- Listing the party's home on the MLS
- Showing the party's home to potential buyers
- Representing the party's interests as a buyer at an open house
#### Special Agency ≠ Binding
A significant limitation in special agency relationships is that **special agents are unable to make decisions that would bind or obligate the party they represent.**
#### Example

When Seller Tim signs a listing agreement with Broker Sally, he granted Sally special agency to list his house on MLS, negotiate with potential buyers, and host open houses at his residence on the weekends.

Seller Tim does not, however, authorize Broker Sally to make decisions that bind him. For example, Sally cannot accept an offer from a buyer on Tim's behalf. Tim still gets to make the decision to accept a buyer's offer.

### Between the Broker and the Party
Agency is created on the broker level
Whatever duties the broker owes the represented party, those obligations are shared by that broker's sponsored licensees as well.
#### Example

Broker Natalie sponsors 15 licensees. One of her sales associates, Audrey, gets a seller to sign a listing agreement.

Who owes that seller duties? Well, because agency is created at the broker level, Broker Natalie and ALL of her 15 sponsored licensees owe the seller duties.

And who are the special agents representing the seller? That's right: Broker Natalie and ALL of her 15 sponsored licensees.

All for one and one for all!
Agency relationships are created at the broker level has certain implications:
- **Commission:** The commission rate is negotiated between the party and the broker.
- **Listings:** If a sales associate switches brokerages, the parties the licensee was working with before the switch remain with the sales associate's former sponsoring broker.
End of chapter example:

A special agent's scope of authority is narrow and usually:
- short term
## General Agency
A **general agent** is one who is **authorized to manage all of a party's affairs within certain specified areas**

**special agent < general agent < universal agent**

A general agent is typically someone authorized to represent the **ongoing** business interests of another
#### Ongoing

### General Agency in Real Estate
The classic example of a general agency relationship is **the relationship between a broker and a sponsored licensee.**
- The sponsored licensee is the general agent of the broker.
- The broker is the party represented by the sponsored licensee.
Interestingly enough, the general agency a broker extends to the sponsored licensee allows the licensee to operate as a special agent on behalf of the broker's customers and clients.
![General agency flow chart showing a broker entrusts sponsored licensee to act as a special agent to preform duties owed to the party representative.](https://d1u7daj727sadp.cloudfront.net/images/FL_GeneralAgencyRelationship_4426.png)

The general agency that exists between a broker and a sponsored licensee:
- Gives the licensee a broader (than special agency) scope of authority to act AND
- Holds the broker responsible for actions performed by their agent (the sponsored licensee)- 
#### Example
When Sales Associate Selah signs a listing agreement with Seller Tim, Sales Associate Selah has created a binding agency relationship between Seller Tim and Selah's broker.
Because of the _general agency_ relationship that exists between sponsored licensees and their brokers, Selah's broker will honor Sales Associate Selah's action of entering into the listing agreement on their behalf.

### The Ties that Bind
the ability to bind.

- Special agency ≠ binding authority
    
- **General agency = binding authority**
		Also universal has binding

### General Agency in Property Management
License holders operating as **property managers** also **require general agency** to carry out their duties for a couple of reasons:
1. Their duties are **ongoing** and multifaceted within their area of concern, so they need a **wider scope of authority**.
2. They typically have the **power to bind** the principal (property owner) to rental agreements and other needed contracts.

Which of the following is an example of a general agency relationship?
- a broker and a sponsored licensee 

### Example
Anthony is Joe's agent, operating as the property manager of the luxury apartment building Joe owns. Anthony's responsibilities are ongoing and have binding power on Joe. What kind of agent is Anthony?
general agent

What kind of agency exists between Broker Joseph and Sales Associate Tatiana? Tatiana's first assignment was to become familiar with the brokerage policy manual and her scope of authorized activities. Why would that information be important to their agency relationship?

As a sponsored sales associate, Tatiana is a general agent for Broker Joseph, meaning that she has a fairly broad scope of authority to act in his name. And because of that, the limits of Tatiana's general agency need to be spelled out — which happens to be the exact purpose for the policy manual and the onboarding process that provided Tatiana with a list of her authorized activities.
### Example
While reading her scope of authorized activities, Tatiana noticed that Broker Joseph authorized new sales associates to list residential real estate properties but did NOT authorize them to list commercial real estate.
In order to list commercial real estate, Broker Joseph required every sponsored sales associate to:
- Have at least two years of real estate sales experience
- Complete a commercial real estate education class

Why do you think listing commercial real estate was placed outside of a new licensee's scope of authority by Broker Joseph?
Commercial real estate often involves a greater deal of complexity and often involves higher priced properties. Since Broker Joseph could be held liable for the authorized activities of new licensees, he likely feels that commercial real estate requires greater experience and expertise than new licensees have, and he does not want to be held responsible for rookie mistakes!

### Example
Fast-forward three months, and Anna, a friend and local businesswoman, approaches Tatiana, saying that she planned to list her warehouse for sale. Anna asks if Tatiana will handle it for her since Anna feels she can trust Tatiana.

Tatiana, wanting to help her friend, has Anna sign a listing agreement.!

Anna asks Tatiana to help her list her warehouse for sale. Tatiana then asks her to sign a listing agreement.

Several weeks later, however, a deal falls through on Anna's property, and Anna blames Tatiana for mismanaging the deal.

When Anna complains to the state real estate commission, Broker Joseph is asked by state officials whether Tatiana had operated under the scope of her authorized activities.

Answer:
Because Tatiana was not authorized to list commercial properties and because Joseph has a paper with Tatiana's signature showing that she understood she was not approved to list commercial real estate, Tatiana may face a possible suspension or revocation of her real estate license and any potential financial restitution. If Joseph were unaware of and did not approve of Tatiana's involvement in this transaction, only Tatiana should be held responsible

#### Example:
Sales Associate Andie's supervising broker is Geni. In their general agency relationship, who is the party being represented?

Geni

## General Agent: Broker Responsibility
- sponsored licensees have the ability to bind their broker to the actions the licensees take 
- the broker can be held responsible for the approved actions of their sponsored licensees.
#### Discipline, Violations, and Penalties
per Florida Statute 475.25(1)(q), the **Commission may suspend or revoke a license or impose a fine up to $5,000 per violation** of any provision of Sections 475.2755 or 475.278, including the duties owed under those sections.
The misdeeds of a sponsored licensee can get a broker into trouble.
#### Public Record
Information that is placed on record with the Department of Business and Professional Regulation includes:
- The name and address of each licensed broker and sales associate
- The name and business address of each sales associate’s employer (meaning their sponsoring broker)
- The sales associate’s and broker’s license status (active or inactive)
- The person’s involvement as an officer, director, or partner of a real estate business

![A flow chart showing an agency relationship triangle.](https://d1u7daj727sadp.cloudfront.net/images/FL_AgencyRelationshipTriangle_4427.png)

### Special Agency
The broker has a _special agency_ relationship with the party.
Meaning that the represented party has entrusted the broker to perform specific actions on their behalf (such as selling a home).
### General Agency
Brokers, on the other hand, have a _general agency_ relationship with their sponsored licensees. This empowers those licensees to fulfill the duties brokers owe the applicable party.
 Consequently, that general agency relationship holds brokers responsible for the actions performed by their sponsored licensees.

### Universal Agency
**Universal agency** is the most broad type of agency.
Universal agency gives agents the power to act on behalf of the party _AND_ make decisions on behalf of the party in all business matters of concern.

This is different from general agency in that:
- A general agent might have broad authority to act, but regarding ONLY a specific business concern of the party.
- A universal agent has the scope of authority to act on the party's behalf for ALL business concerns.
#### Power of Attorney
rare,  universal agency is usually granted to an agent via a **power of attorney** — a legal instrument used to confer the right of one individual to act on behalf of another.

As an **attorney-in-fact**, has the power to sign legal documents on behalf of the party they represent.

Example:
An adult son is asked to oversee the affairs of his elderly father. The acceptance of this responsibility comes with authority (universal agency) for the adult son to monitor his father's health and well-being and to manage all financial aspects of his father's estate.

#### Universal Agency in Real Estate
Although the use of universal agency rarely happens in real estate, it can have its place. One possible scenario in which a party may employ universal agency is if the party is abroad and while trying to sell their home. They may want to give their agent power of attorney to complete the sale of their property in their absence.

RECAP:
- The broadest form of agency
- Uncommon in real estate; and, when needed,
- Usually be granted via a general power of attorney

![A nested venn diagram of Agency Classifications. Within universal agency there is general agency and the special agency.](https://d1u7daj727sadp.cloudfront.net/images/FL_AgencyClassifications_4635.png)


Facts of a feather:
No agency:
- a party rejecting an offer of representation
- a party rejecting an offer of representation
Universal Agency:
- the broadest form of agency
- usually given via a power of attorney
General agency:
- the broker-sponsored licensee relationship
- a broad scope of authority within a limited area of concern
special agency:
- the most limited form of agency
- the broker-party relationship

Practical application in field:
In general, in your role as a sponsored licensee, your agency relationships usually boil down to this:
- You have general agency to act on your broker's behalf.
- You have special agency to act on the customer's and client's behalf.
