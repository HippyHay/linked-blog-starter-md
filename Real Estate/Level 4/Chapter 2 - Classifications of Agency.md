## Three Agency Classifications
- Special agency
- General agency    
- Universal agency
## Special Agency
**Special agency**, a.k.a. _limited agency_, restricts an agent's scope of authority to one or more specific acts as directed by the party — usually towards a single, specific objective, end, or goal.
Not ongoing
Most limited in scope
#### Example
Due to a scheduling conflict, Betty couldn't make it to the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce charity auction. So she authorized Buddy to attend the auction and bid on an exquisite vase she's had her eye on ever since the auction program was posted on the town's website two weeks earlier. Betty instructed Buddy to bid on that one item only. She gave him a top-bid limit of $750.
Buddy's special agency was restricted in scope in two respects:
1. He could only bid on the specific vase Betty wanted.
2. He could bid no more than $750 for the vase.
#### Special Agency in Real Estate
**The relationship between real estate brokers and the parties they represent will almost always be a special agency relationship,** with the single, specific goal being the sale or purchase of a property.![A special agency flow chart showing a broker is authorized to preform specific actions for the party represented.](https://d1u7daj727sadp.cloudfront.net/images/FL_SpecialAgencyRelationship_4425.png)
#### Actions
- Listing the party's home on the MLS
- Showing the party's home to potential buyers
- Representing the party's interests as a buyer at an open house
#### Special Agency ≠ Binding
A significant limitation in special agency relationships is that **special agents are unable to make decisions that would bind or obligate the party they represent.**
#### Example

When Seller Tim signs a listing agreement with Broker Sally, he granted Sally special agency to list his house on MLS, negotiate with potential buyers, and host open houses at his residence on the weekends.

Seller Tim does not, however, authorize Broker Sally to make decisions that bind him. For example, Sally cannot accept an offer from a buyer on Tim's behalf. Tim still gets to make the decision to accept a buyer's offer.

### Between the Broker and the Party
Agency is created on the broker level
Whatever duties the broker owes the represented party, those obligations are shared by that broker's sponsored licensees as well.
#### Example

Broker Natalie sponsors 15 licensees. One of her sales associates, Audrey, gets a seller to sign a listing agreement.

Who owes that seller duties? Well, because agency is created at the broker level, Broker Natalie and ALL of her 15 sponsored licensees owe the seller duties.

And who are the special agents representing the seller? That's right: Broker Natalie and ALL of her 15 sponsored licensees.

All for one and one for all!
Agency relationships are created at the broker level has certain implications:
- **Commission:** The commission rate is negotiated between the party and the broker.
- **Listings:** If a sales associate switches brokerages, the parties the licensee was working with before the switch remain with the sales associate's former sponsoring broker.
End of chapter example:

A special agent's scope of authority is narrow and usually:
- short term
## General Agency
A **general agent** is one who is **authorized to manage all of a party's affairs within certain specified areas**

**special agent < general agent < universal agent**

A general agent is typically someone authorized to represent the **ongoing** business interests of another
#### Ongoing

### General Agency in Real Estate
The classic example of a general agency relationship is **the relationship between a broker and a sponsored licensee.**
- The sponsored licensee is the general agent of the broker.
- The broker is the party represented by the sponsored licensee.
Interestingly enough, the general agency a broker extends to the sponsored licensee allows the licensee to operate as a special agent on behalf of the broker's customers and clients.

The general agency that exists between a broker and a sponsored licensee:
- Gives the licensee a broader (than special agency) scope of authority to act AND
- Holds the broker responsible for actions performed by their agent (the sponsored licensee)- 
#### Example
When Sales Associate Selah signs a listing agreement with Seller Tim, Sales Associate Selah has created a binding agency relationship between Seller Tim and Selah's broker.
Because of the _general agency_ relationship that exists between sponsored licensees and their brokers, Selah's broker will honor Sales Associate Selah's action of entering into the listing agreement on their behalf.

### The Ties that Bind
the ability to bind.

- Special agency ≠ binding authority
    
- **General agency = binding authority**
		Also universal has binding

### General Agency in Property Management
License holders operating as **property managers** also **require general agency** to carry out their duties for a couple of reasons:
1. Their duties are **ongoing** and multifaceted within their area of concern, so they need a **wider scope of authority**.
2. They typically have the **power to bind** the principal (property owner) to rental agreements and other needed contracts.

Which of the following is an example of a general agency relationship?
- a broker and a sponsored licensee
