## Three Agency Classifications
- Special agency
- General agency    
- Universal agency
### Special Agency
**Special agency**, a.k.a. _limited agency_, restricts an agent's scope of authority to one or more specific acts as directed by the party — usually towards a single, specific objective, end, or goal.
Not ongoing
Most limited in scope
#### Example
Due to a scheduling conflict, Betty couldn't make it to the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce charity auction. So she authorized Buddy to attend the auction and bid on an exquisite vase she's had her eye on ever since the auction program was posted on the town's website two weeks earlier. Betty instructed Buddy to bid on that one item only. She gave him a top-bid limit of $750.
Buddy's special agency was restricted in scope in two respects:
1. He could only bid on the specific vase Betty wanted.
2. He could bid no more than $750 for the vase.
#### Special Agency in Real Estate
**The relationship between real estate brokers and the parties they represent will almost always be a special agency relationship,** with the single, specific goal being the sale or purchase of a property.![A special agency flow chart showing a broker is authorized to preform specific actions for the party represented.](https://d1u7daj727sadp.cloudfront.net/images/FL_SpecialAgencyRelationship_4425.png)
