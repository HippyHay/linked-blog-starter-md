After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain the components of agency creation
- Describe how different types of agency are created
- Discuss the advantages of written vs. oral agency creation
#### Certain Agency Relationships = Fiduciary Relationships
The term _fiduciary_ speaks to the highest level of trust that is expected in certain relationships — particularly those having financial implications.
### Compensation ≠ Agency Relationship
While we're on the subject of money, it should be noted that in real estate, compensation does NOT equal agency representation.
- The party they represent
- The party on the other side of the transaction
- Another source
- Or some mix of the above

### The Components of Agency
Creation of agency requires two essential components:
1. Consent
2. Control
### Consent
- created as s result of mutual consent or agreement between the agent and  the party they will represent.
**both the agent AND the party to be represented must give consent**
### Control
**Control** has to do with the idea that the agent (broker or sponsored sales associate) has authority to act on behalf of the customer or client.
## Describing Agency Creation
Agency can be described in terms of:
- The **manner** in which it is created
- The degree of **authority** and **liability** it brings
- The **form** that it takes
### Agency Creation
Agency can be created:
- Orally
- In writing
- By implication or action
But while that is true, it bears repeating that **it is best to create agency in writing.**
## Express Agency
Express agency **can be created in written or oral form**. Both forms are considered valid, with **the written form offering more clarity and protection for both parties**. In either case, **express agency is created when a party explicitly appoints an agent to act on their behalf**.
- most popular way that agency is created.
### The Tools of Express Agency and Express Authority
In real estate, the best tools used to express express agency (see what I did there?) are the:
- Listing agreement
- Buyer-representation agreement
### Express Oral Agency
While express oral agency is a valid way to create agency, the prudent licensee will always confirm and clarify it with written express agency.

## About That Express Oral Agency
- It is **more difficult to enforce**.
- It is more likely to lead to complaints and/or lawsuits (when compared to written agency).
- It typically does not allow a listing agent to use the MLS like written listing agreements do.
### Best Practices
At a minimum, the written agreement should:
- Address the duties of both parties
- Sufficiently protect both parties
**A written agency contract is your best insurance for making sure you get paid** and outlining the who, what, where, and when of compensation. Oral agency is NOT the best way to outline compensation.
